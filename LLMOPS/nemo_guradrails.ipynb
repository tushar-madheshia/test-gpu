       "'India has a multi-party political system, with numerous parties vying for power at national, state, and local levels. The two main national parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Indian National Congress (INC), with the former being the ruling party currently. The BJP is a right-wing party, characterized by its strong stance on nationalism and promotion of Hindu culture, while the INC leans towards center-left, advocating for secularism and social justice. Apart from these, several regional parties such as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Trinamool Congress (TMC), and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) hold significant influence in their respective states. Coalition governments are common in India, as no single party often secures a majority on its own, leading to alliances between parties with shared interests and ideologies.'"
