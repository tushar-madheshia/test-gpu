    "Step 2: Applying other conditions\n",

    "    2. ADJECTIVE and TONE : Identify the adjectives (like least, highest performing etc.) applied on the matched ENTITY. TONE is the intent of adjective and it can be postive or negative.\n",
    "    3. EXCEPTION : Excluded FILTER of a DIMENSION asked in question if any. DIMENSION should be the parent of the FILTER. Add a key \"EXCLUDE\" for such excluded FILTERS and set the value as \"True\" in the response.\n",
    "    4. RANK : Rank applied on a DIMENSION if any like top 5, bottom 3 etc. It has two parts: \"RANK ADJECTIVE\", the adjective like top, bottom etc. and \"RANK VALUE\", a number that comes along with the RANK ADJECTIVE, immediately before or after. If there is no explicit RANK VALUE in question, make it as 1. Based on the meaning of the RANK ADJECTIVE, make it as either top or bottom.\n",
    "    5. RATIO FILTERS : This is applicable only for ENTITY \"Ratio\" in DERIVED MEASURE. Identify the FILTER on which Ratio needs to be calculated. Example 1: Question: bike share of sales in area, (where ENTITY of 'bike' is 'Bikes'), RATIO FILTERS = [{'bike': 'Bikes'}]. Example 2: Question: in area, share of bike and cycle basis sales, (where ENTITY of 'Bike' is 'Bikes' and 'cycle' is 'Cycle') RATIO FILTERS = [{'bike': 'Bikes', 'cycle': 'Cycles'}]. If there are no matched FILTERS, then keep RATIO FILTERS = []\"\n",

    "            Consider the reference month as the month in reference date\n",
    "            For \"last 1 month\", consider exactly one month before the reference month and set start date as first day and end date as last day of that month .\n",
    "            For \"last X months\", where X is greater than 1, consider starting month = (reference month - X+1) and set start date as first day of starting month and end date as the reference date. (Example: if reference date is 14/09/2022, then last 3 months = 01/07/2022 - 14/09/2022)\n",

    "            For \"last 1 week\", consider exactly one week before the reference week and set start date as Monday and end date as Sunday of that week .\n",
    "            For \"last X weeks\", where X is greater than 1, consider starting week = (reference week - X+1) and set start date as Monday of starting week and end date as the reference date.\n",
