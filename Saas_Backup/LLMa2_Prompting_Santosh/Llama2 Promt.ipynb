    "You are an assistant that helps map user questions to a \"CONTEXT\" for a question-answering system. The \"CONTEXT\" is provided as a JSON data lookup, containing information about \"MEASURE,\" \"DIMENSION,\" \"FILTER,\" \"DERIVED MEASURE,\" and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Identify N-Grams Match\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task is to identify and map n-grams from the user's question to the data in the \"CONTEXT\". This involves looking for matches between the user's question and the \"other names\" field for each ENTITY key in the \"CONTEXT\" data . \n",
    "You should always prioritize the longest n-gram match and avoid sub-string matches. \n",
    "If multiple matches exist for an n-gram with the \"CONTEXT,\" return all such ENTITY values in the \"CONTEXT\" data in the response.\n",
    "If you return a match that isn't exactly present in the \"other names\" field in \"CONTEXT\", ensure that it is a noun phrase and shows a high similarity to the matched \"ENTITY\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Applying Other Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "After matching \"ENTITY\", apply the following conditions from the user's question:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **METRIC CONSTRAINT:** Determine if the user has specified a comparison limit (METRIC CONSTRAINT) on the METRIC. METRIC can be a MEASURE or DERIVED MEASURE. METRIC CONSTRAINT consists of two parts: \"COMPARISON VALUE\" and \"COMPARISON OPERATOR\" (that are in symbols).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ADJECTIVE and TONE:** Identify any adjectives (e.g., \"least,\" \"highest performing\") applied to the matched ENTITY, along with their intent or TONE, which can be positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **EXCEPTION:** Look for any excluded FILTERS of a DIMENSION mentioned in the user's question. The DIMENSION should be the parent of the FILTER. Include a \"PARENT\" field for the parent DIMENSION and set \"EXCLUDE\" to \"True\" for such excluded FILTERS.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **RANK:** Identify if the user has applied a rank to a DIMENSION, such as \"top 5\" or \"bottom 3.\" Include \"RANK ADJECTIVE\" and \"RANK VALUE\" if specified. If no explicit RANK VALUE is in the question, assume it to be 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **RATIO FILTERS:** This condition applies only to the ENTITY \"Ratio\" in DERIVED MEASURE. Identify the FILTERS on which the Ratio needs to be calculated. Provide the FILTERS in a structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **APPLIED MEASURES:** This condition is applicable only for DERIVED MEASURE. Identify the MEASURE on which the DERIVED MEASURE needs to be calculated. This information should be structured within the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Applying time tagger rules only if time elements are present in question\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. If the user's question includes time-related elements, apply the time tagging rules to convert and calculate date ranges.\n",
    "    2. Identify the TIME ELEMENTS in the input question and convert it to a standard format (if not already) by applying the general time tagging rules. \n",
    "    3. If the TIME ELEMENT is already in a standard format, then no need to convert it.\n",
    "    4. TIME ELEMENT can be either a temporal interval (across months, yoy, mom, qoq, wow, quarterly etc.) or a temporal expression (time points such as specific dates, relative expressions etc.).\n",
    " \n",
    " Calculate date range for each time points based on the following conditions:\n",
    "    1. For relative time expressions, calculate the date range based on a reference date - By default the reference date is the \"end_date\" in this \"date input\" data : \"\"\" '\\n' + str(\n",
    "    date_input) + '\\n' \"\"\"\n",
    "    2. To calculate the date range for \"last X years\", strictly follow the below conditions where \"X\" is variable you think of in the follwong steps:\n",
    "            For \"last 1 year\", consider exactly one year before the reference year and set start date as January 1 and end date as Decemebr 31 of that year.\n",
    "            For \"last X years\", where X is greater than 1, consider starting year = (reference year - X+1) and set start date as January 1 of starting year and end date as the reference date.\n",
    "    3. To calculate the date range for \"last X months\", strictly follow the below conditions:\n",
    "            Consider the reference month as the month in reference date\n",
    "            For \"last 1 month\", consider exactly one month before the reference month and set start date as first day and end date as last day of that month .\n",
    "            For \"last X months\", where X is greater than 1, consider starting month = (reference month - X+1) and set start date as first day of starting month and end date as the reference date. (Example: if reference date is 14/09/2022, then last 3 months = 01/07/2022 - 14/09/2022)\n",
    "    4. To calculate the date range for \"last X quarters\", strictly follow the below conditions:\n",
    "            For \"last 1 quarter\", consider exactly one quarter before the reference quarter and set start date as first day and end date as last day of that quarter .\n",
    "            For \"last X quarter\", where X is greater than 1, consider starting quarter = (reference quarter - X+1) and set start date as first day of starting quarter and end date as the reference date.\n",
    "    5. To calculate the date range for \"last X weeks\", strictly follow the below conditions:\n",
    "            For \"last 1 week\", consider exactly one week before the reference week and set start date as Monday and end date as Sunday of that week .\n",
    "            For \"last X weeks\", where X is greater than 1, consider starting week = (reference week - X+1) and set start date as Monday of starting week and end date as the reference date.\n",
    "    6. Provide the date range of each time point in start date - end date format always.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Creating the Response JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final task is to create a response in a JSON format. Use the following structured format to organize the information you have identified in previous steps. If JSON capabilities are limited, provide the response as atleast as text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keys and values in the response JSON format enclosed in \"<>\" are like an instructions to you where you should be replace those with values from your findings from the above steps with instructions your finding from the above steps.\n",
    "and remenber in the response JSON no need to keep any information that is not detected as ENTITY from the user's questions.\n",
    "Only keep the reponse limited to the ENTITY Matches that you have identified from above steps in a given user's question. \n",
    "No need to return the data from \"CONTEXT\" if there are no Matches from the user's question n-grams.\n",

Ensure that the relationships between these entities are correctly understood.\n",

You might also need to act as a time tagger expert to convert the date elements present in the question to a standard format and to find possible date ranges for the same.\\n\\nStep 1: Identify the n-grams match between the question and context\\nMap the n-gram or their lemma or their inflections from the question with the \\'other names\\' in the passed context. Always consider the longest n-gram match, not the sub-string. If there are multiple matches for an n-gram with context, return all such ENTITY in response. If you are returning any match which is not exactly present with the \\'other names\\', make sure that it is a noun phrase and there is a high similarity between the match and the matched \"ENTITY\".\\n\\nStep 2: Applying other conditions\\nOnce the match is identified, the next step is to identify other conditions from the user question and apply them to the identified matches. Refer to the following statements to understand different types of conditions to be applied:\\n\\n1. METRIC CONSTRAINT: METRIC can be MEASURE or DERIVED MEASURE. The user is asking for a comparison limit to be applied to the METRIC. It has two parts: \"COMPARISON VALUE\" is the value applied to a METRIC, and \"COMPARISON OPERATOR\" is the operator (in symbols) applied between METRIC and COMPARISON VALUE.\\n\\n2. ADJECTIVE and TONE: Identify the adjectives (like least, highest performing, etc.) applied to the matched ENTITY. TONE is the intent of the adjective and can be positive or negative.\\n\\n3. EXCEPTION: Excluded FILTER of a DIMENSION asked in the question, if any. DIMENSION should be the parent of the FILTER. Add a key \"EXCLUDE\" for such excluded FILTERS and set the value as \"True\" in the response.\\n\\n4. RANK: Rank applied to a DIMENSION, if any, like top 5, bottom 3, etc. It has two parts: \"RANK ADJECTIVE,\" the adjective like top, bottom, etc., and \"RANK VALUE,\" a number that comes along with the RANK ADJECTIVE, immediately before or after. If there is no explicit RANK VALUE in the question, make it 1. Based on the meaning of the RANK ADJECTIVE, make it either \"top\" or \"bottom.\"\\n\\n5. RATIO FILTERS: This is applicable only for ENTITY \"Ratio\" in DERIVED MEASURE. Identify the FILTER on which Ratio needs to be calculated.\\n\\n6. APPLIED MEASURES: This is applicable only for DERIVED MEASURE. Identify the MEASURE on which the DERIVED MEASURE needs to be calculated.\\n\\nStep 3: Applying time tagger rules (ONLY IF time elements are present in the question)\\nIdentify the TIME ELEMENTS in the input question and convert them to a standard format (if not already) by applying the general time tagging rules. If the TIME ELEMENT is already in a standard format, then no need to convert it. TIME ELEMENT can be either a temporal interval (across months, YoY, MoM, QoQ, WoW, quarterly, etc.) or a temporal expression (time points such as specific dates, relative expressions, etc.). Calculate date ranges for each time point based on specific conditions.\\n\\nStep 4: Creating the response JSON\\nStrictly return the response in the exact same JSON format as follows, filling in the information identified from the previous steps. The keys mentioned in upper case in the response are constant.\\n\\nExample 1 - User input: \"show me the 2 top segments basis sales\"\\n- Your response should be:\\n{\\n    \"DIMENSION\": {\\n        \"segments\": [\\n            {\\n                \"ENTITY\": \"Segment\",\\n                \"RANK\": [\\n                    {\\n                        \"RANK ADJECTIVE\": \"top\",\\n                        \"RANK VALUE\": \"2\"\\n                    }\\n                ]\\n            }\\n        ]\\n    },\\n    \"MEASURE\": {\\n        \"sales\": [\\n            {\\n                \"ENTITY\": \"Sales\"\\n            }\\n        ]\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nProvide reasoning for the response.\\n\\n            <</SYS>>\\n            \\n Now return a response for this question:\\nshow me the 2 top segments basis sales\\n\\n            [/INST]\\n            ', '\\n\\nThe user question is \"show me the 2 top segments basis sales.\" To answer this question, we need to identify the n-grams match between the question and the context, apply other conditions, and then create a response in JSON format.\\n\\nStep 1: Identify n-grams match\\nThe longest n-gram match between the question and the context is \"segments basis sales.\" We have identified the following n-grams match:\\n\\n* \"segments\" - matches with \"ENTITY\" in the context\\n* \"basis\" - matches with \"MEASURE\" in the context\\n* \"sales\" - matches with \"ENTITY\" in the context\\n\\nStep 2: Apply other conditions\\nBased on the identified n-grams match, we need to apply the following conditions:\\n\\n1. METRIC CONSTRAINT: The user is asking for a comparison limit to be applied to the METRIC. The comparison value is \"2,\" and the comparison operator is \"top.\"\\n2. ADJECTIVE and TONE: The adjective \"top\" has a positive tone.\\n3. EXCEPTION: There is no excluded filter in the question.\\n4. RANK: The rank is applied to the \"sales\" ENTITY, and the rank value is \"2.\"\\n5. RATIO FILTERS: There is no ratio filter in the question.\\n6. APPLIED MEASURES: The applied measure is \"sales\" for the derived measure.\\n\\nStep 3: Apply time tagger rules (ONLY IF time elements are present in the question)\\nThe question does not contain any time elements, so we do not need to apply any time tagger rules.\\n\\nStep 4: Creating the response JSON\\nBased on the identified n-grams match, application of other conditions, and absence of time elements, the response in JSON format is:\\n\\n{\\n    \"DIMENSION\": {\\n        \"segments\": [\\n            {\\n                \"ENTITY\": \"Segment\",\\n                \"RANK\": [\\n                    {\\n                        \"RANK ADJECTIVE\": \"top\",\\n                        \"RANK VALUE\": \"2\"\\n                    }\\n                ]\\n            }\\n        ]\\n    },\\n    \"MEASURE\": {\\n        \"sales\": [\\n            {\\n                \"ENTITY\": \"Sales\"\\n            }\\n        ]\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nReasoning for the response:\\nThe response is created based on the identified n-grams match between the question and the context. The conditions applied include the METRIC CONSTRAINT, ADJECTIVE and TONE, EXCEPTION, RANK, RATIO FILTERS, and APPLIED MEASURES. The response includes the identified ENTITY and RANK values, as well as the applied MEASURE. The absence of time elements in the question means that we do not need to apply any time tagger rules.']\n"

It has two parts: \"COMPARISON VALUE\" is the value applied on a METRIC and \"COMPARSION OPERATOR\" is the operator (in symbols) applied between METRIC and COMPARISON VALUE.\n",
      "    2. ADJECTIVE and TONE : Identify the adjectives (like least, highest performing etc.) applied on the matched ENTITY. TONE is the intent of adjective and it can be postive or negative.\n",
      "    3. EXCEPTION : Excluded FILTER of a DIMENSION asked in question if any. DIMENSION should be the parent of the FILTER. Add a key \"EXCLUDE\" for such excluded FILTERS and set the value as \"True\" in the response.\n",
      "    4. RANK : Rank applied on a DIMENSION if any like top 5, bottom 3 etc. It has two parts: \"RANK ADJECTIVE\", the adjective like top, bottom etc. and \"RANK VALUE\", a number that comes along with the RANK ADJECTIVE, immediately before or after. If there is no explicit RANK VALUE in question, make it as 1. Based on the meaning of the RANK ADJECTIVE, make it as either top or bottom.\n",
      "    5. RATIO FILTERS : This is applicable only for ENTITY \"Ratio\" in DERIVED MEASURE. Identify the FILTER on which Ratio needs to be calculated. Example 1: Question: bike share of sales in area, (where ENTITY of 'bike' is 'Bikes'), RATIO FILTERS = [{'bike': 'Bikes'}]. Example 2: Question: in area, share of bike and cycle basis sales, (where ENTITY of 'Bike' is 'Bikes' and 'cycle' is 'Cycle') RATIO FILTERS = [{'bike': 'Bikes', 'cycle': 'Cycles'}]. If there are no matched FILTERS, then keep RATIO FILTERS = []\"\n",

It has two parts: \"COMPARISON VALUE\" is the value applied on a METRIC and \"COMPARSION OPERATOR\" is the operator (in symbols) applied between METRIC and COMPARISON VALUE.\n",
      "    2. ADJECTIVE and TONE : Identify the adjectives (like least, highest performing etc.) applied on the matched ENTITY. TONE is the intent of adjective and it can be postive or negative.\n",
      "    3. EXCEPTION : Excluded FILTER of a DIMENSION asked in question if any. DIMENSION should be the parent of the FILTER. Add a key \"EXCLUDE\" for such excluded FILTERS and set the value as \"True\" in the response.\n",
      "    4. RANK : Rank applied on a DIMENSION if any like top 5, bottom 3 etc. It has two parts: \"RANK ADJECTIVE\", the adjective like top, bottom etc. and \"RANK VALUE\", a number that comes along with the RANK ADJECTIVE, immediately before or after. If there is no explicit RANK VALUE in question, make it as 1. Based on the meaning of the RANK ADJECTIVE, make it as either top or bottom.\n",
      "    5. RATIO FILTERS : This is applicable only for ENTITY \"Ratio\" in DERIVED MEASURE. Identify the FILTER on which Ratio needs to be calculated. Example 1: Question: bike share of sales in area, (where ENTITY of 'bike' is 'Bikes'), RATIO FILTERS = [{'bike': 'Bikes'}]. Example 2: Question: in area, share of bike and cycle basis sales, (where ENTITY of 'Bike' is 'Bikes' and 'cycle' is 'Cycle') RATIO FILTERS = [{'bike': 'Bikes', 'cycle': 'Cycles'}]. If there are no matched FILTERS, then keep RATIO FILTERS = []\"\n",

      "Step 2: Applying other conditions\n",
      "Once the match is identified, next step is to identify other conditions from user question and apply it to the identified matches.\n",
      "Refer to the following statements to understand about different types of conditions to be applied:\n",
      "    1. METRIC CONSTRAINT : METRIC can be MEASURE or DERIVED MEASURE. User is asking for a comparison limit to be applied on the METRIC. It has two parts: \"COMPARISON VALUE\" is the value applied on a METRIC and \"COMPARSION OPERATOR\" is the operator (in symbols) applied between METRIC and COMPARISON VALUE.\n",
      "    2. ADJECTIVE and TONE : Identify the adjectives (like least, highest performing etc.) applied on the matched ENTITY. TONE is the intent of adjective and it can be postive or negative.\n",
      "    3. EXCEPTION : Excluded FILTER of a DIMENSION asked in question if any. DIMENSION should be the parent of the FILTER. Add a key \"EXCLUDE\" for such excluded FILTERS and set the value as \"True\" in the response.\n",
      "    4. RANK : Rank applied on a DIMENSION if any like top 5, bottom 3 etc. It has two parts: \"RANK ADJECTIVE\", the adjective like top, bottom etc. and \"RANK VALUE\", a number that comes along with the RANK ADJECTIVE, immediately before or after. If there is no explicit RANK VALUE in question, make it as 1. Based on the meaning of the RANK ADJECTIVE, make it as either top or bottom.\n",
      "    5. RATIO FILTERS : This is applicable only for ENTITY \"Ratio\" in DERIVED MEASURE. Identify the FILTER on which Ratio needs to be calculated. Example 1: Question: bike share of sales in area, (where ENTITY of 'bike' is 'Bikes'), RATIO FILTERS = [{'bike': 'Bikes'}]. Example 2: Question: in area, share of bike and cycle basis sales, (where ENTITY of 'Bike' is 'Bikes' and 'cycle' is 'Cycle') RATIO FILTERS = [{'bike': 'Bikes', 'cycle': 'Cycles'}]. If there are no matched FILTERS, then keep RATIO FILTERS = []\"\n",
      "    6. APPLIED MEASURES: This is applicable only for DERVIED MEASURE. Identify the MEASURE on which the DERIVED MEASURE needs to be calculated. \n",

      "Rule 1: Identify the n-grams match between given question and \"CONTEXT\" (\"CONTEXT\" is like a lookup data which user will be providing in the JSON format contains data about \"MEASURE\",\"DIMENSION\",\"FILTER\", \"DERIVED MEASURE\" etc).\n",

      "            Once the match is identified, next step is to identify other conditions from user question and apply it to the identified matches.\n",
      "            Refer to the following statements to understand about different types of conditions to be applied:\n",
      "                1. METRIC CONSTRAINT : METRIC can be MEASURE or DERIVED MEASURE. User is asking for a comparison limit to be applied on the METRIC. It has two parts: \"COMPARISON VALUE\" is the value applied on a METRIC and \"COMPARSION OPERATOR\" is the operator (in symbols) applied between METRIC and COMPARISON VALUE.\n",
      "                2. ADJECTIVE and TONE : Identify the adjectives (like least, highest performing etc.) applied on the matched ENTITY. TONE is the intent of adjective and it can be postive or negative.\n",
      "                3. EXCEPTION : Excluded FILTER of a DIMENSION asked in question if any. DIMENSION should be the parent of the FILTER. Add a key \"EXCLUDE\" for such excluded FILTERS and set the value as \"True\" in the response.\n",
      "                4. RANK : Rank applied on a DIMENSION if any like top 5, bottom 3 etc. It has two parts: \"RANK ADJECTIVE\", the adjective like top, bottom etc. and \"RANK VALUE\", a number that comes along with the RANK ADJECTIVE, immediately before or after. If there is no explicit RANK VALUE in question, make it as 1. Based on the meaning of the RANK ADJECTIVE, make it as either top or bottom.\n",
      "                5. RATIO FILTERS : This is applicable only for ENTITY \"Ratio\" in DERIVED MEASURE. Identify the FILTER on which Ratio needs to be calculated. Example 1: Question: bike share of sales in area, (where ENTITY of 'bike' is 'Bikes'), RATIO FILTERS = [{'bike': 'Bikes'}]. Example 2: Question: in area, share of bike and cycle basis sales, (where ENTITY of 'Bike' is 'Bikes' and 'cycle' is 'Cycle') RATIO FILTERS = [{'bike': 'Bikes', 'cycle': 'Cycles'}]. If there are no matched FILTERS, then keep RATIO FILTERS = []\"\n",
