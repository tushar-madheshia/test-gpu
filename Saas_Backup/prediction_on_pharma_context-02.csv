- ""why"" is matched to the ""Why"" entity under DERIVED MEASURE in the context.
- ""total prescription"" is matched to the ""TRx"" entity under MEASURE in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date component
- The query mentions ""last two years"", which needs to be converted into a date range.
- The end_date in the date reference is '10/11/2023', so we need to go back 2 years from this date.
- Subtracting 2 years from '10/11/2023' gives us the date '10/11/2021'.
- Since the query asks for the last two years, we need to include the end_date in the date range.

Step 3: Convert date component using date reference
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '01/01/2019', 'end_date': '10/11/2023'}.
- To find the date range for the last 2.5 years, we need to subtract 2.5 years from the end_date.
- 2.5 years is equivalent to 30 months (2 years = 24 months, 0.5 year = 6 months, total = 30 months).
- Subtracting 30 months from the end_date (10/11/2023) gives us (10/11/2023 - 30 months = 2021/03/10).
- Therefore, the date range for the last 2.5 years is 2021/03/10 - 2023/10/11.

- The query asks for the trend of fresh brand prescription for cardio in the last 6 months.
- Components identified: trend, fresh brand prescription, cardio, last 6 months

Step 2: Match components to the context
- trend: not found in the context, so we need to derive it using other components
- fresh brand prescription: found in the context under 'NRx'
- cardio: found in the context under 'Specialty'
- last 6 months: not found in the context, so we need to calculate it using the date reference

Step 3: Derive missing components
- Since the query asks for the trend, we can use the 'NRx' component to calculate the growth rate. The growth rate will give us the trend of fresh brand prescriptions.
- To calculate the last 6 months, we need to use the date reference. The date reference has a start_date of '01/01/2019' and an end_date of '10/11/2023'. We need to find the date range that is 6 months ago from the end_date.
- The end_date is '10/11/2023', so 6 months ago would be '10/11/2023 - 6 months'.
- Since there are 6 months in a year, 6 months ago from '10/11/2023' would be '10/11/2023 - 6 months = 2023/05/11'.
- Therefore, the date range for the last 6 months is '2023/05/11 - 2023/10/"

list of zip codes in Brownsville ,"{'ZIP_CODE': [{'ENTITY': 'Zip_Code', 'PARENT': 'State', 'VALUE': 'Brownsville'}]}","Step 1: Identify the components in the query
- The query asks for a ""list of zip codes"" in Brownsville.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- In the context, we find that ""Zip_Code"" is a sub-entity of ""State"" with other names like ""postal_code"", ""zipcode"", ""post_code"", and ""mailing_code"".
- We also find that Brownsville is a city in the State of Texas.

Step 3: Convert the query into a structured output
- Since the query asks for a list of zip codes in Brownsville, we need to filter the Zip_Code sub-entity to include only those that are associated with Brownsville.
- To do this, we can use the parent-child relationship between Zip_Code and State to find all the zip codes that are children of Brownsville.
- In this case, Brownsville has one child zip code, which is ""78584"".
- So, the structured output will include only this zip code.

Step 4: Handle the date component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '01/01/2019', 'end_date': '10/11/2023'}.
- However, the query does not ask for any data analysis or time-series information.
- Therefore, the date reference is not utilized in the structured output.

Rationale:
- The query asks for a list of zip codes in Brownsville, which is a city in the State of Texas.
- We match the components to the context and find that Zip_Code is a sub-entity of State with other names like ""Zip_Code"".
- We then filter the Zip_Code sub-entity to include only those that are associated with Brownsville using the parent-child relationship between Zip_Code and State.
- The structured output will include only the zip code ""78584"", which is the child zip code of Brownsville.
- The date reference is not utilized in the structured output as the query does not ask for any data analysis or time-series information.

[MQL]
the structured output is generated based on the identified components, matched to the context, and the filtered Zip_Code sub-entity. The output includes only the zip code ""78584"", which is the child zip"

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Specialties: Found in the context under ""SPECIALTY"" with ENTITY ""Specialty""
- Healdsburg: Found in the context under ""FILTER"" with ENTITY ""Healdsburg"" and its parent is ""State""

Step 3: Convert the query into a structured output
- Since the query is asking for specialties available in healdsburg, we need to include the ""SPECIALTY"" component with its ENTITY ""Specialty"" and its parent ""Healdsburg""

Step 4: Check for date components
- The query does not have any date components, so the date reference is not utilized in this case.

Rationale:
- The query asks for specialties available in healdsburg, so we need to identify the specialties component and the healdsburg component from the context.
- We match the components to the context and find that the specialties component is under ""SPECIALTY"" with ENTITY ""Specialty"" and its parent is ""Healdsburg"".
- Since the query does not have any date components, the date reference is not utilized in this case.
- The structured output is created by including the ""SPECIALTY"" component with its ENTITY ""Specialty"" and its parent ""Healdsburg"".

Note: The date reference was not utilized in this case as the query did not have any date components.
