Number of ship modes boosting sales over 3 months?,How many ship mode contributing to growth of sale across 3 months,howmany_contribute_to_growth,"{'MEASURE': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales', 'other names': ['sale', 'sales']}], 'DIMENSION': [{'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode', 'other names': ['ship mode']}], 'FILTER': [], 'DERIVED MEASURE': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'other names': ['contributing']}, {'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'other names': ['growth'], 'dataset_id': 'non'}, {'ENTITY': 'contribution_to_growth', 'other names': ['contributing to growth'], 'dataset_id': 'non'}], 'DATE VARIABLE': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'other names': ['date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', 'order date']}]}","{'MEASURE': {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'ship mode': [{'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'contributing to growth': [{'ENTITY': 'contribution_to_growth', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'sale': 'Sales'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'3 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 3 months'}]}}","Step 1: Identify the components in the query
- In the query ""How many ship mode contributing to growth of sale across 3 months"", we can identify the following components:
  - Ship mode (DIMENSION)
  - Contributing to growth (DERIVED MEASURE)
  - Sale (MEASURE)
  - 3 months (DATE VARIABLE)

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Ship mode: In the context, we can find ""Ship Mode"" under DIMENSION with other names as ""ship mode"".
- Contributing to growth: In the context, we can find ""contribution_to_growth"" under DERIVED MEASURE with other names as ""contributing to growth"".
- Sale: In the context, we can find ""Sales"" under MEASURE with other names as ""sale"" and ""sales"".
- 3 months: In the context, we can find ""Order Date"" under DATE VARIABLE with other names such as ""date"", ""when"", ""yoy"", ""trend"", ""mom"", ""time"", and ""order date"".

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query mentions ""across 3 months"", which can be interpreted as the last 3 months from the end date given in the date reference (31/12/2021). So, we convert ""3 months"" to ""last 3 months"" in the structured output.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date/time component, we create the structured output with the following structure:
  - MEASURE: {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}
  - DIMENSION: {'ship mode': [{'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode'}]}
  - DERIVED MEASURE: {'contributing to growth': [{'ENTITY': 'contribution_to_growth', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'sale': 'Sales'}]}]}
  - DATE VARIABLE: {'3 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 3 months'}]}

Rationale:
- The query asks for the number of ship modes that contribute to the growth of sales in the last 3 months. To answer this, we need to consider the sales measure, the ship mode dimension, and the derived measure of contribution to growth. We also need to take into account the time frame of 3 months, which we have converted to the last 3 months based on the date reference provided.","{'MEASURE': {'sales': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'ship mode': [{'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'boosting': [{'ENTITY': 'contribution_to_growth', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'sales': 'Sales'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'3 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 3 months'}]}}"

- The query mentions ""discount percentage"" and ""sales"" as the two measures.
- It also mentions a comparison for both measures: ""greater than 20000"" for discount percentage and ""< 100k"" for sales.
- The query specifies a time constraint: ""in the last 10 months.""
- The question asks for the first time these conditions were met.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- In the context, we find ""Discount percentage"" and ""Sales"" as entities with dataset_id '6538e14185a957419006d762'.
- The context also provides ""Order Date"" as a date variable with other names like ""time"" and ""when.""

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query mentions ""in the last 10 months,"" which can be mapped to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context.
- We can use the ""last 10 months"" as a constraint for the ""Order Date"" entity.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- For the ""discount percentage"" measure, we add the entity and its comparison constraint (greater than 20000).
- For the ""sales"" measure, we add the entity and its comparison constraint (less than 100000).
- For the date variable, we add the ""Order Date"" entity with the ""last 10 months"" constraint.

Rationale:
- The query asks for the first time when two conditions are met: discount percentage is greater than 20000, and sales are less than 100k.
- We identified the relevant entities and constraints from the context and the query.
- We converted the date/time component by mapping it to the ""Order Date"" entity and using the ""last 10 months"" constraint.
- The structured output includes the measures, their constraints, and the date variable with its constraint.","{'MEASURE': {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '20000', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}], 'sales': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '100000', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '<'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'when': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 months'}]}}"

- The query asks for a list of customer ids.
- The ranking is based on profits.
- The time frame is the last 10 days.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Customer ID is found in the context as 'Customer ID' with other names 'customer id'.
- Profits are found in the context as 'Profit' with other names 'profits'.
- Order Date is found in the context as 'Order Date' with other names like 'date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', 'order date'.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query mentions ""last 10 days"", which is a relative time frame.
- The context provides start and end dates, but we need to convert the relative time frame to an absolute one.
- To do this, we can calculate the last 10 days from the end date provided in the context (31/12/2021).

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The MEASURE component is 'profits', which is matched to the context as 'Profit'.
- The DIMENSION component is 'customer id', which is matched to the context as 'Customer ID'. The query also asks for the ""top"" customer id, so we add a RANK with the adjective 'top' and value '1'.
- The DATE VARIABLE component is 'last 10 days', which is matched to the context as 'Order Date' and the converted time element 'last 10 days'.

The structured output is created by combining these matched components and their corresponding context information.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'customer id': [{'ENTITY': 'Customer ID', 'RANK': [{'RANK ADJECTIVE': 'top', 'RANK VALUE': '1'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'past 10 days': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 days'}]}}"

- The query asks for the ""yearly trend"" which is a date/time component.
- It mentions ""share of envelopes"" which is a derived measure (ratio) and a filter (envelopes).
- It also mentions ""Thailand"" which is another filter (Southeast Asia region).
- The query is about ""profits"" which is the measure.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""profits"" can be matched to the 'Profit' entity in the context.
- ""envelopes"" can be matched to the 'Envelopes' entity with parent 'Sub-Category' in the context.
- ""Thailand"" can be matched to the 'Southeast Asia' entity with parent 'Region' in the context.
- ""share"" can be matched to the 'ratio' entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query asks for the ""yearly trend"" which means we need to analyze the data across years.
- The date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'.
- The date variable in the context is 'Order Date'.
- So, we need to convert the 'Order Date' variable to represent data across years.

Rationale:
- The query is asking for the yearly trend of the share of envelopes and Thailand in profits.
- We need to filter the data for envelopes and the Southeast Asia region (specifically Thailand) to focus on the relevant information.
- The derived measure (ratio) is applied to the profit measure to calculate the share of envelopes in profits.
- The date variable (Order Date) is converted to represent data across years to analyze the yearly trend.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'FILTER': {'envelope': [{'ENTITY': 'Envelopes', 'PARENT': 'Sub-Category'}], 'thailand': [{'ENTITY': 'Southeast Asia', 'PARENT': 'Region'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'share': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'RATIO FILTER': [{'envelope': 'Envelopes'}], 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'yearly pattern': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across years'}]}}"

- Bottom sub category: Matches with 'Sub-Category' in the context under 'DIMENSION'
- Discount percentage: Matches with 'Discount percentage' in the context under 'MEASURE'
- Previous quarter: Matches with 'Order Date' in the context under 'DATE VARIABLE'

Step 3: Convert the query components into structured output
- Bottom sub category: Since the query asks for the bottom sub category, we add a 'RANK' element with 'RANK ADJECTIVE' as 'bottom' and 'RANK VALUE' as '1' to the 'Sub-Category' entity.
- Discount percentage > 50k: Add a 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT' element to the 'Discount percentage' entity with 'COMPARISON VALUE' as '50k' and 'COMPARISON OPERATOR' as '>'.
- Previous quarter: Add a 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' to the 'Order Date' entity with the value 'last quarter' to represent the previous quarter.

Rationale:
The query asks for the bottom sub category with a discount percentage greater than 50k in the previous quarter. We identified the relevant components in the query and matched them to the context provided. Then, we converted these components into structured output by adding appropriate elements and constraints. The date/time component was converted by adding a 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' to the 'Order Date' entity to represent the previous quarter.","{'MEASURE': {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '50k', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'sub-category': [{'ENTITY': 'Sub-Category'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'last quarter': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last quarter'}]}}"

- In the query ""What is the profits across 2 months"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Date variable: 2 months

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: The context provides a measure called ""Profit"" with other names as ""profits"". So, we can match the measure ""profits"" in the query to the ""Profit"" entity in the context.
- Date variable: The context provides a date variable called ""Order Date"" with other names like ""trend"", ""yoy"", ""mom"", ""date"", ""order date"", ""when"", ""time"". Although the query doesn't explicitly mention any of these names, we can infer that the date variable ""2 months"" is related to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}. However, the query asks for profits across 2 months. To convert this date variable, we can use the term ""last 2 months"" to represent the time period of interest. This will allow us to calculate the profits for the last 2 months within the given date range.

Rationale:
- The measure ""profits"" was matched to the ""Profit"" entity in the context.
- The date variable ""2 months"" was inferred to be related to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context.
- The date/time component was converted to ""last 2 months"" to represent the time period of interest within the given date range.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'2 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 months'}]}}"

- In the query ""What is the monthly trend of share of ship mode sale"", we can identify the following components:
  - ""monthly trend"" as a date variable
  - ""share"" as a derived measure
  - ""ship mode"" as a dimension
  - ""sale"" as a measure

Step 2: Match components to the context
- Match ""ship mode"" to the dimension ""Ship Mode"" in the context
- Match ""sale"" to the measure ""Sales"" in the context
- Match ""share"" to the derived measure ""ratio"" in the context
- Match ""monthly trend"" to the date variable ""Order Date"" in the context

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- The date variable ""monthly trend"" needs to be converted to a time element that represents the trend across months. In the context, ""Order Date"" is the relevant date variable, so we convert ""monthly trend"" to ""across months"" for ""Order Date"".

Rationale:
- The query asks for the monthly trend, which means we need to analyze the data across months. By converting ""monthly trend"" to ""across months"" for ""Order Date"", we ensure that the structured output will provide the desired time-based analysis.

Step 4: Create structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date/time component, we can now create the structured output with the following elements:

- In the query ""List of customer id having profits more than 10k"", we can identify the following components:
  - Customer ID (Dimension)
  - Profits (Measure)
  - 10k (Comparison Value)
  - More than (Comparison Operator)

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- From the given context, we can match the identified components as follows:
  - Customer ID: {'ENTITY': 'Customer ID', 'other names': ['customer id']}
  - Profits: {'ENTITY': 'Profit', 'other names': ['profits']}
  - 10k: This is a numerical value and does not require matching with the context.
  - More than: This is a comparison operator and does not require matching with the context.

Step 3: Handle the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- In the given query, there is no specific mention of a date or time constraint. Therefore, we can assume that the query is applicable for the entire date range provided in the date reference.

Step 4: Convert the query into a structured output
- Based on the matched components and the date reference, we can create the structured output as follows:
  - MEASURE: {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '10000', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}]}
  - DIMENSION: {'customer id': [{'ENTITY': 'Customer ID'}]}

Rationale:
- The query asks for a list of customer IDs with profits more than 10k. Therefore, we need to include the Customer ID dimension in the output.
- The query also specifies a constraint on the profits measure, which is more than 10k. We include this constraint in the MEASURE section of the structured output.
- Since there is no specific date or time constraint mentioned in the query, we do not need to include any date variable in the structured output.

- The query mentions ""Haiti"" and ""Central Asia,"" which are not present in the context but can be considered as additional filters.
- The query mentions ""across 2.5 months,"" which is a date/time component that needs to be converted.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The 'Discount percentage' entity in the context is matched to the 'discount percentage' mentioned in the query.
- Since ""Haiti"" and ""Central Asia"" are not present in the context, they will be added as additional filters in the structured output.
- The date/time component ""across 2.5 months"" needs to be converted to a format that can be used in the structured output.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query mentions ""across 2.5 months,"" which can be converted to days by multiplying 2.5 by 30 (assuming 30 days in a month), resulting in 75 days.
- Since the query is asking for data across the last 2.5 months, the structured output should include a 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' with the value 'last 75 days' for the 'Order Date' entity.

Rationale: The query is asking for the discount percentage of Haiti and Central Asia across the last 2.5 months.

- The query asks for the discount percentage across 2.5 months. We need to calculate the start and end dates for this period.
- Since the query does not specify a starting point for the 2.5 months, we can assume it is asking for the most recent 2.5 months within the date reference.
- Calculate 2.5 months before the end date '31/12/2021': This would be around '16/10/2021' (approximately 75 days before the end date).
- So, the time range for the query would be from '16/10/2021' to '31/12/2021'.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the identified components and processed date/time component, the structured output would include:
  - Measure: Discount percentage (with dataset_id)
  - Filter: Location (Haiti)
  - Date range: '16/10/2021' to '31/12/2021'","{'MEASURE': {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'2': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount percentage': 'Discount percentage'}]}]}}"

- The query mentions ""top ship mode,"" which refers to the dimension 'Ship Mode.'
- The query mentions ""sale,"" which refers to the measure 'Sales.'
- The query mentions ""across 3 months,"" which is a date/time component.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- 'Ship Mode' is matched to the context as {'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode', 'other names': ['ship mode']}.
- 'Sales' is matched to the context as {'ENTITY': 'Sales', 'other names': ['sale']}.
- 'Order Date' is matched to the context as {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'other names': ['date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', 'order date']}.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date/time component ""across 3 months"" is converted to ""last 3 months"" as it refers to a period of 3 months. This is represented as {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 3 months'} in the structured output.

Step 4: Combine the components into the structured output
- The measure 'Sales' is represented as {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}.
- The dimension 'Ship Mode' is represented as {'ship mode': [{'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode', 'RANK': [{'RANK ADJECTIVE': 'top', 'RANK VALUE': '1'}]}]}.
- The date variable 'Order Date' is represented as {'3 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 3 months'}]}.

- Bottom cities: This refers to the cities with the lowest values for a particular measure.
- Growth rate of discount: This is a derived measure that represents the rate of change in the discount.
- March 2022: This is a date variable that specifies the time period for the analysis.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Bottom cities: This can be matched to the 'City' entity in the context under 'DIMENSION'.
- Growth rate of discount: This can be matched to the 'Growth Rate' entity in the context under 'DERIVED MEASURE', with the applied measure being 'Discount'.
- March 2022: This can be matched to the 'Order Date' entity in the context under 'DATE VARIABLE'.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- March 2022: The date reference provided in the context is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'. However, the query asks for data in March 2022, which is outside the given date range. In this case, we can still convert the date component to 'March 2022' under the 'Order Date' entity, but it's important to note that the data might not be available for this time period.

Rationale:
The query aims to find the cities with the lowest growth rate of discount in March 2022. To achieve this, we need to identify the relevant dimensions, measures, and date variables from the context and match them to the components in the query. The structured output is then created by combining these matched components, taking into consideration the date range provided in the context.","{'DIMENSION': {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City', 'RANK': [{'RANK ADJECTIVE': 'bottom', 'RANK VALUE': '1'}]}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'growth rate': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount': 'Discount'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'Mar '22': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'March 2022'}]}}"

- In the query ""What is the correlation between profits and discounts"", we can identify the following components:
  - Derived Measure: correlation
  - Measure 1: profits
  - Measure 2: discounts

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- We match the identified components to the context provided:
  - Derived Measure: correlation is matched to {'ENTITY': 'correlation', 'other names': ['correlation']}
  - Measure 1: profits is matched to {'ENTITY': 'Profit', 'other names': ['profits']}
  - Measure 2: discounts is matched to {'ENTITY': 'Discount', 'other names': ['discounts'], 'dataset_id': '6538e14185a957419006d762'}

  - DERIVED MEASURE: {'correlation': [{'ENTITY': 'correlation', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}, {'discounts': 'Discount'}]}]}

Step 4: Incorporate the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- Since the query does not explicitly mention any date or time-related information, we assume that the correlation is to be calculated for the entire date range provided in the date reference.

- The query mentions ""ratio"", which is a derived measure.
- It also mentions ""Haiti"" and ""Central Asia"", which are filters.
- The query asks for ""discount percentage"", which is a measure.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The derived measure ""ratio"" can be found in the context under 'DERIVED MEASURE'.
- The filter ""Central Asia"" can be matched to the context filter ""Southeast Asia"" as they both belong to the 'Region' parent.
- The measure ""discount percentage"" can be found in the context under 'MEASURE'.

Step 3: Handle the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- Since the query does not mention any specific date or time period, we can assume that the analysis should be done within the given date range.

Step 4: Convert the query into a structured output
- The FILTER component in the structured output should include the ""Central Asia"" filter, with its parent ""Southeast Asia"" from the context.
- The DERIVED MEASURE component should include the ""ratio"" derived measure, with the ""RATIO FILTER"" containing the ""Central Asia"" filter and its parent ""Southeast Asia"".
- The ""APPLIED MEASURE"" in the DERIVED MEASURE component should include the ""discount percentage"" measure from the context.
- The ""DERIVED MEASURE CONSTRAINT"" should be left empty, as there is no comparison value or operator mentioned in the query.

In the query, we have ""discount percentage"" and ""shipping cost"" as the measures. We match these to the context and find that they correspond to the entities 'Discount percentage' and 'Shipping Cost'.

Step 2: Identify the dimensions in the query
The query mentions ""sub category"" and ""order priority"" as the dimensions. We match these to the context and find that they correspond to the entities 'Sub-Category' and 'Order Priority'.

Step 3: Identify the date variable in the query
The query mentions ""across 2 months"" as the time component. We match this to the context and find that it corresponds to the entity 'Order Date'.

Step 4: Convert the date variable to a specific time range
Since the query asks for data ""across 2 months"", we need to convert this to a specific time range. Given the date reference with a start date of '03/01/2018' and an end date of '31/12/2021', we can determine that the ""last 2 months"" would be the appropriate time range to use.

- In the query ""What is the profits of el salvador across 2 months"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Date variable: 2 months

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: The context provides a mapping for ""profits"" to the entity ""Profit"".
- Date variable: The context provides a mapping for ""Order Date"" and its other names, which include time-related terms like ""trend"", ""yoy"", ""mom"", ""date"", ""order date"", ""when"", and ""time"".

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date variable in the query is ""2 months"". Since the date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021', we can interpret ""2 months"" as the last 2 months within this date range. Therefore, we can convert ""2 months"" to ""last 2 months"" in the context of the ""Order Date"" entity.

Rationale:
- The query asks for profits across 2 months, which implies a time period of 2 months. Given the date reference, we can assume that the user is interested in the last 2 months within the provided date range. Hence, we convert ""2 months"" to ""last 2 months"" in the context of the ""Order Date"" entity.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit', 'ADJECTIVE': ['profits']}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'2-month': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 months'}]}}"

- Bottom cities: This matches the 'City' entity in the context under 'DIMENSION'.
- Share of discount: This matches the 'ratio' entity in the context under 'DERIVED MEASURE', with the applied measure being 'Discount' from the 'MEASURE' in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}. This information can be used to filter the data within the specified date range.

Step 4: Structure the output
- DIMENSION: The 'City' entity is used, with a 'RANK' of 'bottom' and a 'RANK VALUE' of '1', indicating the lowest-ranked city.
- DERIVED MEASURE: The 'ratio' entity is used, with the applied measure being 'Discount', resulting in the 'share of discount'.

Rationale:
The query asks for the bottom cities based on the share of discount. To answer this, we need to rank the cities based on the derived measure 'share of discount', which is the ratio of the discount. The date reference provided helps to filter the data within the specified date range, ensuring that the analysis is relevant to the given time period. The structured output captures this information by specifying the 'City' entity with the appropriate ranking and the derived measure 'share of discount' with the applied measure 'Discount'.","{'DIMENSION': {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City', 'RANK': [{'RANK ADJECTIVE': 'bottom', 'RANK VALUE': '1'}]}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'share': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount': 'Discount'}], 'DERIVED MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': ''}]}]}}"

- The query asks for ""discount"" and ""quantities"", which are measures.
- It also mentions ""cities"" and ""region"", which are dimensions.
- The query specifies a time frame of ""across 2 months"".

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""Discount"" can be matched to the entity ""Discount"" in the context.
- ""Quantities"" can be matched to the entity ""Quantity"" in the context.
- ""Cities"" can be matched to the entity ""City"" in the context.
- ""Region"" can be matched to the entity ""Region"" in the context.
- The date reference in the context is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query asks for data ""across 2 months"". Since no specific months are mentioned, we can assume it refers to the last 2 months from the end date in the context ('31/12/2021').
- Therefore, the converted time element is ""last 2 months"".

  - ""sale"" refers to the measure we are interested in.
  - ""15d"" refers to a date variable, specifically a future time period of 15 days.
  - ""Kenya"" is not explicitly mentioned in the context, but it can be inferred as a filter or dimension related to the location.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Match ""sale"" to the context: In the context, we can see that ""sale"" is listed as an other name for the entity ""Sales"". So, we can match ""sale"" to the ""Sales"" entity.
- Match ""15d"" to the context: In the context, we have a date variable ""Order Date"" with other names like ""date"", ""when"", ""yoy"", ""trend"", ""mom"", ""time"", and ""order date"". Since ""15d"" is a date variable, we can match it to the ""Order Date"" entity.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- Convert ""15d"" to a more structured format: Since ""15d"" refers to a future time period of 15 days, we can convert it to a more structured format by associating it with the ""Order Date"" entity and specifying it as ""next 15 days"".

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date/time component, we can create the structured output as follows:

- 'key drivers' can be matched to the derived measure 'kda' with other names ['key driver', 'drivers', 'key drivers']
- 'discount' can be matched to the measure 'Discount' with other names ['discounts', 'discount']

Step 3: Create the structured output
Based on the matched components, we can create the structured output as follows:
- For the derived measure 'key drivers', we add the ENTITY 'kda' and an empty DERIVED MEASURE CONSTRAINT with no comparison value or operator.

Step 4: Incorporate the date/time component
Since there is no specific date or time component mentioned in the query, we can assume that the analysis should be done for the entire date range provided in the date reference, i.e., from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'. This information can be used while processing the structured output for further analysis.

Rationale:
The query asks for the key drivers of discount, which is a derived measure. By matching the components in the query to the context, we can identify the relevant entities and create a structured output that represents the query. The date range provided in the date reference is assumed to be the default range for the analysis since no specific date or time component is mentioned in the query.","{'DERIVED MEASURE': {'key drivers': [{'ENTITY': 'kda', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discounts': 'Discount'}]}]}}"

- The query asks for the yearly trend of profits and discounts for envelopes in the last 10 days. So, the components are profits, discounts, envelopes, yearly trend, and last 10 days.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Profits: Matched to the 'Profit' entity in the context under 'MEASURE'.
- Discounts: Matched to the 'Discount' entity in the context under 'MEASURE'.
- Envelopes: Matched to the 'Envelopes' entity in the context under 'FILTER'.
- Yearly trend: Matched to the 'Order Date' entity in the context under 'DATE VARIABLE'.
- Last 10 days: Also matched to the 'Order Date' entity in the context under 'DATE VARIABLE'.

Step 3: Convert the date/time components
- Yearly trend: Since the query asks for the yearly trend, the 'Order Date' entity is converted to 'across years' in the structured output.
- Last 10 days: As the query specifies the last 10 days, the 'Order Date' entity is also converted to 'last 10 days' in the structured output.

Rationale: The query asks for the yearly trend of profits and discounts for envelopes in the last 10 days. To achieve this, we need to consider the 'Order Date' entity in two different ways: across years and last 10 days. This allows us to analyze the data for the specified time frame and provide the desired output.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}], 'discounts': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount'}]}, 'FILTER': {'envelope': [{'ENTITY': 'Envelopes', 'PARENT': 'Sub-Category'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'reason for': [{'ENTITY': 'why'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'yearly trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across years'}], 'past 10 days': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 days'}]}}"

- The query mentions ""lowest,"" which is an adjective describing the discount percentage.
- The query mentions ""previous quarter,"" which is a time element related to the 'Order Date' entity in the context.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The 'Discount percentage' entity in the context is matched to the 'discount percentage' component in the query.
- The 'Sub-Category' entity in the context is matched to the 'sub category' component in the query.
- The 'Order Date' entity in the context is matched to the 'previous quarter' time element in the query.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The 'previous quarter' time element in the query needs to be converted to a structured output format.
- Since the 'Order Date' entity in the context has the other names 'time' and 'when,' we can use 'when' as the key for the date variable in the structured output.
- The 'previous quarter' time element is then converted to 'last quarter' as the value for the 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' key in the structured output.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The identified components and their matches in the context are used to create the structured output.
- The 'discount percentage' component is added as a key in the 'MEASURE' dictionary, with the 'Discount percentage' entity and the adjective 'lowest' as its values.
- The 'sub category' component is added as a key in the 'DIMENSION' dictionary, with the 'Sub-Category' entity as its value.

- In the query ""What is the sale across 3 months"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: ""sale""
  - Date variable: ""3 months""

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: ""sale"" can be matched to the entity ""Sales"" in the context, as it is mentioned in the 'other names' list.
- Date variable: ""3 months"" is not directly mentioned in the context, but we can infer that it is related to the ""Order Date"" entity, as it is a time-based variable.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date variable ""3 months"" needs to be converted into a structured format. Since the query asks for sales across 3 months, we can interpret this as the ""last 3 months"" from the given date reference (end_date: '31/12/2021'). 

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date variable, we can create the structured output as follows:

- The query mentions ""discount percentage"" and ""sales"" as the two measures.
- The query specifies a condition for both measures: ""greater than 20000"".
- The query asks for the ""first time"" this condition is met.
- The query mentions ""Haiti"" as a location.
- The query specifies a time frame: ""last 10 months"".

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""Discount percentage"" can be matched to the entity ""Discount percentage"" in the context.
- ""Sales"" can be matched to the entity ""Sales"" in the context.
- The date variable ""Order Date"" can be used for the time component in the query.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query specifies ""last 10 months"" as the time frame. This can be converted using the date reference provided, which has a start date of '03/01/2018' and an end date of '31/12/2021'. We can calculate the last 10 months from the end date and use it as a constraint for the ""Order Date"" entity.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- For both ""Discount percentage"" and ""Sales"" entities, add the measure constraint with a comparison value of '20000' and a comparison operator of '>'.
- Add the adjective ""first time"" to both entities to indicate that we are looking for the first occurrence of the condition being met.
- Add the ""Order Date"" entity with the converted time element ""last 10 months"" as a constraint.

Rationale:
The structured output is created by identifying the components in the query, matching them to the context, converting the date/time component, and then organizing the information into a structured format. This allows for a clear and concise representation of the query, making it easier to process and analyze.","{'MEASURE': {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '20000', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}], 'sales': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '20000', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'when': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 months'}]}}"

- The query mentions ""bottom product name,"" which indicates a ranking of product names.
- ""Based on monthly trends"" suggests a time element related to months.
- ""For profits"" indicates that the measure of interest is profits.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- In the context, ""Profit"" is the measure that matches ""profits"" in the query.
- ""Product Name"" is the dimension that matches ""product name"" in the query.
- ""Order Date"" is the date variable that matches the time element in the query.

Step 3: Convert the ranking component
- The query asks for the ""bottom"" product name, which means the lowest-ranking product in terms of profits. This is represented as a rank adjective ""bottom"" and a rank value of ""1"" in the structured output.

Step 4: Convert the date/time component
- The query mentions ""monthly trends,"" which means the data should be aggregated across months. This is represented as a converted time element ""across months"" in the structured output.

Step 5: Combine the components into the structured output
- The measure ""profits"" is linked to the entity ""Profit"" from the context.
- The dimension ""product name"" is linked to the entity ""Product Name"" from the context, along with the rank adjective and rank value.
- The date variable ""monthly trends"" is linked to the entity ""Order Date"" from the context, along with the converted time element ""across months.""

- Trend: Indicates a time-based analysis.
- Share: Refers to the derived measure 'ratio'.
- Guinea discount percentage: Refers to the measure 'Discount percentage'.
- Previous quarter: Refers to a specific time period.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Trend: Matches with the 'Order Date' entity in the context.
- Share: Matches with the 'ratio' entity in the derived measure.
- Guinea discount percentage: Matches with the 'Discount percentage' entity in the measure.
- Previous quarter: No direct match in the context, but can be inferred as a time period relative to the date reference.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- Previous quarter: Since the date reference is given as 'start_date': '03/01/2018' and 'end_date': '31/12/2021', we can infer that the previous quarter refers to the last quarter within this date range.

Step 4: Structure the output
- DERIVED MEASURE: The share component is matched to the 'ratio' entity in the derived measure, and the applied measure is 'Discount percentage'.
- DATE VARIABLE: The trend component is matched to the 'Order Date' entity, and the converted time element is 'last quarter'.

Rationale: The question asks for the trend of the share of guinea discount percentage in the previous quarter. By identifying the components in the query and matching them to the context, we can structure the output to include the derived measure 'ratio' with the applied measure 'Discount percentage' and the date variable 'Order Date' with the converted time element 'last quarter'.

- The query asks to list product names based on their contribution to the growth of profits in the 1st quarter of last year. So, the components are:
  - Product Name (dimension)
  - Contribution to growth (derived measure)
  - Profits (measure)
  - 1st quarter of last year (date variable)

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Product Name: In the context, 'Product Name' is given as an entity with other names as 'product name'.
- Contribution to growth: In the context, 'contribution_to_growth' is given as an entity with other names as 'contribution to growth' and 'contributions'.
- Profits: In the context, 'Profit' is given as an entity with other names as 'profits'.
- 1st quarter of last year: In the context, 'Order Date' is given as an entity with other names as 'date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', and 'order date'.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query asks for the 1st quarter of last year. In the context, 'Order Date' is the date variable entity. To convert the date component, we need to find the corresponding time element for the 1st quarter of last year. This can be represented as 'quarter 1 last year'.

Rationale:
- The structured output is created by identifying the components in the query and matching them to the context. The dimension, measure, derived measure, and date variable are all identified and matched to their respective entities in the context.

  - Last 10 days: {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'other names': ['trend', 'yoy', 'mom', 'date', 'order date', 'when', 'time']}

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date/time component in the query is ""last 10 days"". We need to convert this into a structured format using the date reference provided:
  - Start date: 03/01/2018
  - End date: 31/12/2021
- Since the query asks for the last 10 days, we can calculate the date range by subtracting 10 days from the end date (31/12/2021). This gives us a new date range for the ""last 10 days"" component.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Using the matched components and the converted date/time component, we can now create the structured output:

- In the query ""List of ship mode having sale > 50k"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: sale
  - Dimension: ship mode
  - Comparison value: 50k
  - Comparison operator: >

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: ""sale"" can be matched to the ""Sales"" entity in the context with other names ['sale'].
- Dimension: ""ship mode"" can be matched to the ""Ship Mode"" entity in the context with other names ['ship mode'].
- Date reference: The date reference is not explicitly mentioned in the query, but we can use the given date reference {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.

Step 3: Convert the components into a structured output
- Measure: Since the query mentions ""sale > 50k"", we can create a measure constraint with the comparison value '50k' and the comparison operator '>'.
  - {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '50k', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}]}
- Dimension: The query asks for a ""list of ship mode"", so we can include the 'Ship Mode' entity as a dimension.
  - {'ship mode': [{'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode'}]}

Step 4: Combine the structured output components
- Combine the measure and dimension components to form the final structured output:

- The query asks for the correlation between two measures: discount percentage and shipping cost.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- From the context, we can find the corresponding entities for the identified components:
  - Discount percentage: {'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage', 'other names': ['discount percentage'], 'dataset_id': '6538e14185a957419006d762'}
  - Shipping cost: {'ENTITY': 'Shipping Cost', 'other names': ['shipping cost'], 'dataset_id': '6538e14185a957419006d762'}

Step 3: Identify the derived measure
- The query asks for the correlation, which is a derived measure. From the context, we can find the corresponding entity for correlation:
  - Correlation: {'ENTITY': 'correlation', 'other names': ['correlation']}

Step 4: Apply the derived measure to the identified components
- We need to apply the correlation derived measure to the identified components (discount percentage and shipping cost). This is represented in the structured output as:
  - {'correlation': [{'ENTITY': 'correlation', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount percentage': 'Discount percentage', 'shipping cost': 'Shipping Cost'}]}]}

Step 5: Consider the date/time component
- The date reference provided in the context is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}. However, the query does not specifically ask for any date-related information or filtering. Therefore, the date/time component is not included in the structured output.

Rationale:
- The structured output is generated by first identifying the components in the query and matching them to the context. Then, the derived measure (correlation) is applied to the identified components (discount percentage and shipping cost). Finally, since the query does not ask for any date-related information, the date/time component is not included in the structured output.","{'DERIVED MEASURE': {'correlation': [{'ENTITY': 'correlation', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount percentage': 'Discount percentage'}, {'shipping cost': 'Shipping Cost'}]}]}}"

- In the query ""List of product name having profits more than 10k"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Dimension: product name
  - Comparison value: 10k
  - Comparison operator: >

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: In the context, we can find the measure 'Profit' with other names ['profits', 'profit']. Since 'profits' is mentioned in the query, we can match it to the 'Profit' entity in the context.
- Dimension: In the context, we can find the dimension 'Product Name' with other names ['product name']. Since 'product name' is mentioned in the query, we can match it to the 'Product Name' entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert the query components into structured output
- Measure: Since we have identified 'profits' as the measure in the query, we can add it to the structured output with the corresponding entity 'Profit' and the measure constraint [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '10k', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}].
- Dimension: Since we have identified 'product name' as the dimension in the query, we can add it to the structured output with the corresponding entity 'Product Name'.

Step 4: Handle the date/time component
- In this case, the query does not mention any specific date or time-related information. However, we have a date reference in the context with start_date and end_date. Since the query does not specify any date constraints, we can assume that the query is asking for the information within the given date range (03/01/2018 to 31/12/2021).

- ""Discount percentage"" is a measure with the other name ""discount percentage""
- ""ratio"" is a derived measure with the other name ""percentage""

Step 3: Form the structured output
- The main dimension we want to focus on is ""sub category"", so we include it in the 'DIMENSION' field of the output
- The derived measure we want to calculate is the ""percentage"" of ""discount percentage"", so we include it in the 'DERIVED MEASURE' field of the output
- Since the query doesn't mention any specific filters or date variables, we don't need to include them in the structured output

Step 4: Handle the date/time component
- The date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'
- The query doesn't mention any specific date or time-related information, so we don't need to include any date variables in the structured output
- However, the date reference can be used to filter the data if needed, but it's not explicitly mentioned in the query, so we don't include it in the structured output

Rationale:
- The query asks for a list of sub-categories based on the percentage of discount percentage
- We identified the relevant components from the query and matched them to the context
- We formed the structured output by including the main dimension (sub category) and the derived measure (percentage of discount percentage)

- Growth rate of discount: This can be matched to the 'Growth Rate' entity in the context under 'DERIVED MEASURE', with the applied measure being 'Discount'.
- March 2022: This can be matched to the 'Order Date' entity in the context under 'DATE VARIABLE'.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- March 2022: The date reference provided in the context is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'. However, the query asks for data in March 2022, which is outside the given date range. In this case, we can still convert the date component to 'March 2022' under the 'Order Date' entity, but it's important to note that the data might not be available for this time period.

Rationale:
The query aims to find the cities with the lowest growth rate of discount in March 2022. To achieve this, we need to identify the relevant dimensions, measures, and date variables from the context and match them to the components in the query. The structured output is then created by combining these matched components, taking into consideration the date range provided in the context.","{'DIMENSION': {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City', 'RANK': [{'RANK ADJECTIVE': 'bottom', 'RANK VALUE': '1'}]}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'growth rate': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount': 'Discount'}], 'DERIVED MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': ''}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'March 22': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'March 2022'}]}}"

- In the query ""What is the profits of el salvador across 2 months"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Date variable: 2 months

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: The context provides a mapping for ""profits"" to the entity ""Profit"".
- Date variable: The context provides a mapping for ""Order Date"" and its other names, which include time-related terms like ""trend"", ""yoy"", ""mom"", ""date"", ""order date"", ""when"", and ""time"".

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date variable in the query is ""2 months"". Since the date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021', we can interpret ""2 months"" as the last 2 months within this date range. Therefore, we can convert ""2 months"" to ""last 2 months"" in the context of the ""Order Date"" entity.

Rationale:
- The query asks for profits across 2 months, which implies a time period of 2 months. Given the date reference, we can assume that the user is interested in the last 2 months within the provided date range. Hence, we convert ""2 months"" to ""last 2 months"" in the context of the ""Order Date"" entity.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'2 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 months'}]}}"

- Order Date: {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'other names': ['date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', 'order date']}

Step 3: Convert the query into structured output
- DIMENSION: Since the query asks for the top customer id, we need to rank the Customer ID dimension. We add the RANK attribute with the 'top' adjective and a rank value of '1'.
- DERIVED MEASURE: The query asks for the yearly growth rate of profits. We apply the Growth Rate entity to the Profit measure and leave the comparison value and operator empty since we are not comparing it to a specific value.
- DATE VARIABLE: The query asks for the yearly growth rate, so we need to convert the Order Date entity to 'across years' to represent the yearly time element.

Rationale:
The structured output is created by identifying the components in the query, matching them to the context, and converting them into the appropriate format. The date/time component is converted by identifying the time element in the query (yearly) and applying it to the Order Date entity.

- The query asks for ""discount"" and ""quantities"", which are measures.
- It also mentions ""cities"", which is a dimension.
- The query specifies two date/time components: ""march 2022"" and ""15d"".

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""discount"" can be matched to the entity ""Discount"" in the context.
- ""quantities"" can be matched to the entity ""Quantity"" in the context.
- ""cities"" can be matched to the entity ""City"" in the context.

- Share of El Salvador to overall profits
- Highest
- 1st quarter of last year

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Share: matches with the derived measure 'ratio'
- Profits: matches with the measure 'Profit'
- Highest: matches with the filter 'High' and the adjective 'highest'
- 1st quarter of last year: matches with the date variable 'Order Date'

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- 1st quarter of last year: This needs to be converted into a specific date range. Since the date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021', the last year in this range is 2021. Therefore, the 1st quarter of last year would be from '01/01/2021' to '31/03/2021'. This date range will be applied to the 'Order Date' variable.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- DERIVED MEASURE: The share component is represented by the derived measure 'ratio', which is applied to the measure 'Profit'. The adjective 'highest' is also added to indicate the tone of the query.
- DATE VARIABLE: The 'Order Date' variable is updated with the converted time element '1st quarter of last year', which corresponds to the date range '01/01/2021' to '31/03/2021'.

  - Across 3 years (Date Variable)

Step 2: Match components to the context
- Match the identified components to the context provided:
  - Customer ID: {'ENTITY': 'Customer ID', 'other names': ['customer id']}
  - Profits: {'ENTITY': 'Profit', 'other names': ['profits']}
  - More than 10k: This is a comparison value and operator, which will be used in the structured output.
  - Across 3 years: This is a date variable that needs to be converted.

Step 3: Convert the date variable
- The date variable ""across 3 years"" needs to be converted to a more structured format. In the context, we have the date reference with start_date and end_date. We can use this information to convert ""across 3 years"" to ""last 3 years"" since the end_date is 31/12/2021.

- The query asks for the ""contribution of discount"" which can be matched to the 'ratio' entity in the DERIVED MEASURE section of the context.
- The query also mentions ""for cities"" which can be matched to the 'City' entity in the DIMENSION section of the context.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The 'ratio' entity in the DERIVED MEASURE section is matched with the 'contribution' keyword in the query.
- The 'City' entity in the DIMENSION section is matched with the 'cities' keyword in the query.

Step 3: Create the structured output
- For the DIMENSION, we include the 'City' entity as {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City'}]}.
- For the DERIVED MEASURE, we include the 'ratio' entity and specify that it is applied to the 'Discount' measure as {'contribution': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount': 'Discount'}]}]}.

  - 'start_date': '03/01/2018'
  - 'end_date': '31/12/2021'
- The date reference is already included in the DATE VARIABLE component of the structured output, so no further action is needed.

Rationale:
- The query is asking for the time when the contribution of discount in cities was the highest. To answer this, we need to consider the measure (discount), dimension (cities), derived measure (contribution), and date variable (when).

- We matched the measure ""discount percentage"" and the date variable ""Order Date"" from the context.
- We then converted the date variable ""previous quarter"" to the standard format ""last quarter"" using the 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' key in the context. This helps in maintaining consistency and understanding the time frame for the analysis.","{'MEASURE': {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount percentage': 'Discount percentage'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'prior quarter': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last quarter'}]}}"

- Based on the identified components and their matches in the context, we can create the structured output as follows:
  - For the 'MEASURE' key, we include the 'sale' component with its corresponding ENTITY ('Sales') and the MEASURE CONSTRAINT (comparison value '50k' and comparison operator '>').
  - For the 'DIMENSION' key, we include the 'ship mode' component with its corresponding ENTITY ('Ship Mode').

Rationale: The structured output is created by identifying the components in the query, matching them to the context, and converting the date/time component. This allows us to represent the query in a structured format that can be easily processed by a data analysis system.","{'MEASURE': {'sales': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '50k', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'ship mode': [{'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode'}]}}"

- Growth contribution
- Overall profits
- Product name
- Across 2 months

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Growth contribution: Matches with 'contribution_to_growth' in DERIVED MEASURE
- Overall profits: Matches with 'Profit' in MEASURE
- Product name: Matches with 'Product Name' in DIMENSION
- Across 2 months: Matches with 'Order Date' in DATE VARIABLE

Step 3: Create the structured output
- DIMENSION: Since the query asks for product name, we include 'Product Name' from the context.
- DERIVED MEASURE: The query asks for growth contribution to overall profits, so we include 'contribution_to_growth' and apply it to the 'Profit' measure.
- DATE VARIABLE: The query specifies a time frame of 2 months, so we convert 'Order Date' to 'last 2 months'.

Rationale:
The query asks for the growth contribution to overall profits for product name across 2 months. We identified the relevant components in the query and matched them to the context. We then created the structured output by including the appropriate dimensions, derived measures, and date variables.

- In the query ""What is the monthly trend of discount and quantities for Burundi"", we can identify the following components:
  - Monthly trend: This is a date/time component that needs to be converted.
  - Discount: This is a measure component.
  - Quantities: This is another measure component.
  - Burundi: This is a filter component, but it is not mentioned in the context, so we will not include it in the structured output.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Discount: We can match this component to the 'Discount' entity in the context.
- Quantities: We can match this component to the 'Quantity' entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- Monthly trend: In the context, we have the 'Order Date' entity with the other name 'trend'. Since the query asks for a monthly trend, we need to convert the 'Order Date' entity to represent data across months. We do this by adding the 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' attribute with the value 'across months' to the 'Order Date' entity in the structured output.

Rationale:
- The query asks for the monthly trend of discount and quantities, so we need to include both the 'Discount' and 'Quantity' entities in the structured output.
- The date/time component 'monthly trend' is matched to the 'Order Date' entity in the context, and we need to convert it to represent data across months.
- The filter component 'Burundi' is not mentioned in the context, so we do not include it in the structured output.","{'MEASURE': {'discount': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount'}], 'quantities': [{'ENTITY': 'Quantity'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across months'}]}}"

- In the query ""What is the profits and sales in 1st quarter of last year"", we can identify the following components:
  - Profits
  - Sales
  - 1st quarter of last year

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Profits: In the context, we can find 'Profit' under 'MEASURE' with other names as 'profits'. So, we can match 'profits' in the query to 'Profit' in the context.
- Sales: In the context, we can find 'Sales' under 'MEASURE' with other names as 'sales'. So, we can match 'sales' in the query to 'Sales' in the context.
- 1st quarter of last year: In the context, we can find 'Order Date' under 'DATE VARIABLE' with other names like 'trend', 'yoy', 'mom', 'date', 'order date', 'when', 'time'. So, we can match '1st quarter of last year' in the query to 'Order Date' in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- The query asks for the 1st quarter of last year. Since the end_date is '31/12/2021', last year would be 2020. Therefore, the 1st quarter of last year would be the period from '01/01/2020' to '31/03/2020'.
- We can represent this as 'quarter 1 last year' in the CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT for 'Order Date' in the structured output.

Rationale: The query asks for profits and sales in the 1st quarter of last year. We identified the components in the query and matched them to the context. Then, we converted the date/time component based on the date reference provided. The structured output represents the required information for profits, sales, and the time period (1st quarter of last year) as per the context.","{'MEASURE': {'sales': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}], 'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'last year': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last year'}]}}"

- The query asks for profits and sales, which are both measures.
- It also mentions two time periods: ""1st quarter of last year"" and ""q2 2020"", which are date variables.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- In the context, we have 'Profit' and 'Sales' as measures, which match the query's request for profits and sales.
- The date variable 'Order Date' in the context can be used to filter the data for the specified time periods.

Step 3: Convert the date/time components
- ""1st quarter of last year"" can be converted to 'quarter 1 last year' as it refers to the first quarter of the previous year.
- ""q2 2020"" is already in a standard format, so it can be directly used as 'quarter 2 2020'.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- For the 'MEASURE' field, map 'profits' to the 'Profit' entity and 'sales' to the 'Sales' entity from the context.
- For the 'DATE VARIABLE' field, map '1st quarter of last year' to the 'Order Date' entity with the converted time element 'quarter 1 last year', and map 'q2 2020' to the 'Order Date' entity with the converted time element 'quarter 2 2020'.

- The query asks for a ""List of sub category""
- It specifies a condition ""except India""

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- In the context, we have a 'Sub-Category' entity under 'DIMENSION' which matches the ""sub category"" component in the query.
- We also have a 'Country' entity under 'DIMENSION' which can be used to filter out India.

Step 3: Create the structured output
- Since the query asks for a list of sub categories, we include the 'Sub-Category' entity in the 'DIMENSION' section of the structured output.
- To filter out India, we need to add a 'FILTER' section in the structured output. However, the query does not mention any specific measure or date range to filter on, so we do not need to include 'MEASURE', 'DERIVED MEASURE', or 'DATE VARIABLE' sections in the structured output.

Rationale:
- The query asks for a list of sub categories, which is a dimension in the context. Therefore, we include it in the 'DIMENSION' section of the structured output.
- The query specifies a condition to exclude India, which is a country. Since 'Country' is a dimension in the context, we can use it to filter out India.

- The context has a date variable ""Order Date"" with other names like ""date"", ""when"", ""yoy"", ""trend"", ""mom"", ""time"", and ""order date"".
- However, the query does not mention any date or time-related information, so we do not need to include the date variable in the structured output.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the identified components and their matches in the context, we can create the structured output.
- The output should include the dimension ""City"" with the filter ""except guinea bissau"".

Rationale:
- The query asks for a list of cities, which is a dimension in the context, so we include it in the structured output.
- The query also specifies to exclude guinea bissau, so we apply this filter to the dimension ""City"".
- Since there is no date or time-related information in the query, we do not include the date variable in the structured output.",{'DIMENSION': {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City'}]}}

- In the query ""What is the percentage of kenya, south korea, moldova and indonesia for sale"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: sale
  - Derived Measure: percentage
  - Dimension: Country (kenya, south korea, moldova, and indonesia)

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: 'sale' can be matched to 'Sales' in the context.
- Derived Measure: 'percentage' can be matched to 'ratio' in the context.
- Dimension: The countries mentioned in the query can be matched to 'Country' in the context.

Step 3: Create the structured output
- For the 'MEASURE' field, we include the matched entity 'Sales' with the key 'sale'.
- For the 'DERIVED MEASURE' field, we include the matched entity 'ratio' with the key 'percentage'. We also need to specify the 'APPLIED MEASURE' field, which in this case is the 'Sales' measure identified earlier.

Step 4: Handle the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- Since the query does not explicitly mention any date or time-related information, we can assume that the analysis should be done within the given date range.

- The query asks for a ""List of customer id"" which is a dimension.
- The query mentions ""across 3 years"" which is a date/time component.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- In the context, we find the dimension ""Customer ID"" with other names as ""customer id"". This matches the ""List of customer id"" in the query.
- The date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021', which is a total of 4 years. However, the query asks for data ""across 3 years"". We need to convert this date/time component accordingly.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- Since the query asks for data across 3 years, we need to adjust the date reference to cover the last 3 years from the end date '31/12/2021'. This means we need to consider data from '01/01/2019' to '31/12/2021'.
- In the context, we find the date variable ""Order Date"" with other names like 'date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', 'order date'. This matches the date/time component in the query.
- We convert the date/time component to ""last 3 years"" for the ""Order Date"" entity.

Step 4: Create the structured output

- ""15d"" can be converted to ""last 15 days"" as it refers to the last 15 days from the current date.

Rationale:
- The query asks for the discount by cities, so we need to identify the measure and dimension in the context.
- The measure ""discount"" is matched to the entity ""Discount"" and the dimension ""cities"" is matched to the entity ""City"".
- The date references in the query are used to filter the data based on the ""Order Date"" entity in the context.

- The query mentions ""profits"" and ""discounts"" which are measures.
- The query mentions ""first time"" which is an adjective.
- The query mentions ""more than 10k"" which is a comparison value and operator.
- The query mentions ""last 10 days"" which is a date/time component.
- The query mentions ""when"" which is a date variable.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""profits"" can be matched to the entity ""Profit"" in the context.
- ""discounts"" can be matched to the entity ""Discount"" in the context.
- ""when"" can be matched to the entity ""Order Date"" in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- ""last 10 days"" is a relative time period that needs to be converted using the date reference provided.
- The date reference has a start date of '03/01/2018' and an end date of '31/12/2021'.
- To convert ""last 10 days"", we need to find the last date in the date reference, which is '31/12/2021', and subtract 10 days from it. This gives us a new date range for the query.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- For the measure ""profits"", add the entity ""Profit"", the comparison value ""10000"", the comparison operator "">"", and the adjective ""first time"".
- For the measure ""discounts"", add the entity ""Discount"", the comparison value ""10000"", the comparison operator "">"", and the adjective ""first time"".
- For the date variable ""When"", add the entity ""Order Date"" and the converted time element ""last 10 days"".

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The context provides the ENTITY 'City' with other names as 'cities'
- The context also provides the ENTITY 'Discount' with other names as 'discounts' and 'discount'

Step 3: Determine the ranking
- The query asks for ""bottom cities"", which implies a ranking in ascending order
- The RANK ADJECTIVE is 'bottom' and the RANK VALUE is '1'

Step 4: Apply the filter
- The query mentions ""except guinea bissau and uzbekistan"", which implies a filter to exclude these two cities

Step 5: Create the structured output
- The DIMENSION is 'cities', which corresponds to the ENTITY 'City'
- The RANK is added with the RANK ADJECTIVE 'bottom' and the RANK VALUE '1'
- The FILTER is applied to exclude 'guinea bissau' and 'uzbekistan'

Step 6: Consider the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}

- In the query ""List of customer id having profits more than 10k"", we can identify the following components:
  - Customer ID (Dimension)
  - Profits (Measure)
  - 10k (Comparison Value)
  - More than (Comparison Operator)

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- From the given context, we can match the identified components as follows:
  - Customer ID: {'ENTITY': 'Customer ID', 'other names': ['customer id']}
  - Profits: {'ENTITY': 'Profit', 'other names': ['profits']}
  - 10k: This is a numerical value and does not require matching with the context.
  - More than: This is a comparison operator and does not require matching with the context.

Step 3: Handle the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- In the given query, there is no specific mention of a date or time constraint. Therefore, we can assume that the query is applicable for the entire date range provided in the date reference.

  - DIMENSION: {'customer id': [{'ENTITY': 'Customer ID'}]}

Rationale:
- The query asks for a list of customer IDs with profits more than 10k. Therefore, we need to include the Customer ID dimension in the output.
- The query also specifies a constraint on the profits measure, which is more than 10k. We include this constraint in the MEASURE section of the structured output.
- Since there is no specific date or time constraint mentioned in the query, we do not need to include any date variable in the structured output.

- The query asks for the ""discount"" which can be matched to the 'Discount' entity in the context.
- The query mentions ""by cities"" which can be matched to the 'City' entity in the context.
- The query specifies ""in March 2022"" which is a date reference that needs to be converted.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The 'Discount' entity in the context has other names such as 'discounts' and 'discount', which matches the query's mention of ""discount"".
- The 'City' entity in the context has other names such as 'cities', which matches the query's mention of ""by cities"".
- The 'Order Date' entity in the context has other names such as 'trend', 'yoy', 'mom', 'date', 'order date', 'when', and 'time', which can be used to convert the date reference in the query.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query specifies ""in March 2022"", which can be converted using the 'Order Date' entity in the context.
- Since the context provides a start date of '03/01/2018' and an end date of '31/12/2021', we need to extend the end date to include March 2022.
- The converted time element for ""in March 2022"" would be 'March 2022'.

- In the query ""What is the monthly trend of contribution of product name profits"", we can identify the following components:
  - ""monthly trend"" as a date/time component
  - ""contribution"" as a derived measure
  - ""product name"" as a dimension
  - ""profits"" as a measure

Step 2: Match components to the context
- Match ""profits"" to the context entity ""Profit"" and its other names.
- Match ""product name"" to the context entity ""Product Name"" and its other names.
- Match ""contribution"" to the context entity ""ratio"" and its other names.
- Match ""monthly trend"" to the context entity ""Order Date"" and its other names.

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- Convert ""monthly trend"" to ""across months"" as it refers to the trend over a period of months.

Step 4: Create structured output

- Discount percentage: Found in the context under 'MEASURE' as 'Discount percentage'
- Furnishing: Found in the context under 'FILTER' as 'Furnishings'
- Date/Time: Found in the context under 'DATE VARIABLE' as 'Order Date'

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- ""previous quarter"" is a relative time period, so we need to convert it to a specific date range based on the date reference provided.
- Date reference: start_date = '03/01/2018', end_date = '31/12/2021'
- Since the end_date is '31/12/2021', the previous quarter would be the last quarter of 2021, which is from '01/10/2021' to '31/12/2021'.
- In the structured output, the 'previous quarter' is represented as 'last quarter' under 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' for 'Order Date'.

- The date variable ""Order Date"" should be included with the converted time element ""last quarter.""

Rationale:
- The query is asking for the bottom sub-category based on the trend of contribution to growth of discount percentage in the previous quarter.
- To answer this, we need to rank the sub-categories based on their contribution to growth of discount percentage in the previous quarter and find the bottom-most one.

- Product name can be matched to the 'Product Name' entity in the context.
- Highest can be considered as an adjective for the 'Profit' entity.
- First time can be matched to the 'Order Date' entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'.

- ""lowest discount percentage contribution to growth"": This refers to the derived measure 'contribution_to_growth' with an adjective 'lowest' and a tone 'negative'.
- ""countries"": This refers to the dimension 'Country'.
- ""last 10 months"": This is a date/time component referring to the 'Order Date' date variable.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""lowest discount percentage contribution to growth"" matches with the derived measure 'contribution_to_growth' in the context.
- ""countries"" matches with the dimension 'Country' in the context.
- ""last 10 months"" matches with the date variable 'Order Date' in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- ""last 10 months"" is a relative time period that needs to be converted based on the date reference provided. Since the end date is '31/12/2021', we can calculate the start date for the last 10 months by subtracting 10 months from the end date. This gives us a new start date for the time period.

- In the query ""List of ship mode basis percentage of sale"", we can identify the following components:
  - Ship mode: This is a dimension.
  - Percentage of sale: This is a derived measure.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Ship mode: In the context, we can find ""Ship Mode"" under the 'DIMENSION' key with the same name.
- Percentage of sale: In the context, we can find ""ratio"" under the 'DERIVED MEASURE' key with the other name ""percentage"". Also, it is related to the measure ""Sales"" which is mentioned in the context under the 'MEASURE' key with the other name ""sale"".

- Match ""change"" to the derived measure ""Growth Rate"" in the context.
- Match ""last 10 days"" to the date variable ""Order Date"" in the context.

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- Convert ""last 10 days"" to a time element by considering the date reference provided (start_date: '03/01/2018', end_date: '31/12/2021'). Since the query asks for the last 10 days, we can calculate the time range by subtracting 10 days from the end_date.

Step 4: Create structured output
- For the measure ""profits"", map it to the entity ""Profit"" from the context.
- For the derived measure ""diagnose"", map it to the entity ""why"" from the context and apply the measure ""profits"" to it.
- For the derived measure ""change"", map it to the entity ""Growth Rate"" from the context and apply the measure ""profits"" to it.
- For the date variable ""last 10 days"", map it to the entity ""Order Date"" from the context and add the converted time element ""last 10 days"".

- Contribution to growth: Matches with ""contribution_to_growth"" in the context
- Profits: Matches with ""Profit"" in the context
- Last 10 days: Matches with ""Order Date"" in the context

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- Last 10 days: This is a relative time period, so we need to convert it to an absolute time range using the date reference provided. Since the end date is 31/12/2021, the last 10 days would be from 22/12/2021 to 31/12/2021.

- The query mentions ""top ship mode"", which refers to the dimension 'Ship Mode'.
- It also mentions ""sale > 50k"", which is a constraint on the measure 'Sales'.
- There is no explicit mention of a date or time component in the query.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- 'Ship Mode' can be matched to the dimension entity 'Ship Mode' in the context.
- 'sale' can be matched to the measure entity 'Sales' in the context.

Step 3: Convert the query components into structured output
- For the dimension 'Ship Mode', we need to find the top ship mode, so we add a 'RANK' attribute with a 'RANK ADJECTIVE' of 'top' and a 'RANK VALUE' of '1'.
- For the measure 'Sales', we have a constraint of sale > 50k, so we add a 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT' with a 'COMPARISON VALUE' of '50k' and a 'COMPARISON OPERATOR' of '>'.

Step 4: Handle the date/time component
- Since there is no explicit mention of a date or time component in the query, we can assume that the date reference provided ('start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021') is applicable to the entire query.
- The date reference can be applied to the 'Order Date' entity in the context, as it is the only date variable mentioned.

Rationale:
- The query asks for the top ship mode with sales greater than 50k, so we need to identify the dimension and measure entities in the context and apply the appropriate constraints and ranking attributes.
- The date reference provided is assumed to be applicable to the entire query, as there is no explicit mention of a date or time component in the query itself.","{'MEASURE': {'sales': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '50k', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'ship mode': [{'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode', 'RANK': [{'RANK ADJECTIVE': 'top', 'RANK VALUE': '1'}]}]}}"

- The query mentions ""trend"", which is related to the date variable ""Order Date"".
- The query mentions ""ratio of discount percentage"", which is a derived measure.
- The query mentions ""guinea"", but it doesn't match any entity in the context. We can assume it's a typo and should be ""to"" instead.
- The query mentions ""furnishing"", which is related to the filter entity ""Furnishings"".

Step 2: Match components to the context
- ""trend"" is matched to the date variable ""Order Date"".
- ""ratio of discount percentage"" is matched to the derived measure ""ratio"" with the applied measure ""Discount percentage"".
- ""furnishing"" is matched to the filter entity ""Furnishings"".

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- The date reference is given as {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- The query mentions ""trend"", which is related to the date variable ""Order Date"". So, we convert the date variable ""Order Date"" to ""trend"" in the structured output.

Step 4: Create structured output
- For the filter component, we include the entity ""Furnishings"" with its parent ""Sub-Category"" under the key ""furnishing"".
- For the derived measure component, we include the entity ""ratio"" with the applied measure ""Discount percentage"" and no constraints.
- For the date variable component, we include the entity ""Order Date"" with the converted time element ""trend"".

- In the query ""What is the yearly growth rate of profits for last 10 days"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Derived Measure: yearly growth rate
  - Date Variable: last 10 days

Step 2: Match components to the context
- Measure: ""profits"" can be matched to the context entity ""Profit"" with other names ['profits', 'profit'].
- Derived Measure: ""yearly growth rate"" can be matched to the context entity ""Growth Rate"" with other names ['growth rate', 'growth'].
- Date Variable: The query mentions ""last 10 days"", which can be matched to the context entity ""Order Date"" with other names ['date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', 'order date'].

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- The query asks for the ""last 10 days"", which can be calculated by subtracting 10 days from the end_date '31/12/2021'. This gives us a new date range for the last 10 days.

Step 4: Create structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date/time component, we can create the structured output as follows:
  - MEASURE: {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}
  - DERIVED MEASURE: {'growth rate': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}], 'ADJECTIVE': ['yearly']}]}
  - DATE VARIABLE: {'last 10 days': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 days'}]}

- In the query ""When was contribution of profits of product name highest"", we can identify the following components:
  - ""contribution of profits"" refers to a derived measure.
  - ""product name"" refers to a dimension.
  - ""highest"" refers to an adjective describing the derived measure.
  - ""When"" refers to a date variable.

Step 2: Match components to the context
- Match ""contribution of profits"" to the derived measure ""ratio"" in the context, as it has the other name ""contribution"".
- Match ""product name"" to the dimension ""Product Name"" in the context.
- Match ""When"" to the date variable ""Order Date"" in the context, as it has the other name ""when"".

Step 3: Create the structured output

- Trend: Indicates a time-based analysis
- Growth rate: A derived measure
- Discount percentage: A measure
- Sub-category: A dimension
- Previous quarter: A date/time component

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Growth rate: Matches with the derived measure ""Growth Rate""
- Discount percentage: Matches with the measure ""Discount percentage""
- Sub-category: Matches with the dimension ""Sub-Category""
- Previous quarter: Needs to be converted based on the date reference

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- Previous quarter: The date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'. Based on this, we need to find the last quarter within this date range. The last quarter would be 'Q4 2021', so the ""previous quarter"" would be 'Q3 2021'.

- In the query ""What is the growth rate of profits for the last 10 days?"", we can identify the following components:
  - Growth rate (derived measure)
  - Profits (measure)
  - Last 10 days (date variable)

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Growth rate: In the context, we find ""Growth Rate"" under 'DERIVED MEASURE' with other names such as ""growth rate"" and ""growth"". So, we can match ""growth rate"" in the query to this entity.
- Profits: In the context, we find ""Profit"" under 'MEASURE' with other names such as ""profits"" and ""profit"". So, we can match ""profits"" in the query to this entity.
- Last 10 days: In the context, we find ""Order Date"" under 'DATE VARIABLE' with other names such as ""date"", ""when"", ""yoy"", ""trend"", ""mom"", ""time"", and ""order date"". So, we can match ""last 10 days"" in the query to this entity.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}. However, the query asks for the ""last 10 days"". To convert this, we can use the 'end_date' as a reference point and calculate the date range for the last 10 days. In this case, the 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' would be 'last 10 days'.

- Last 10 months: Convert this to a time element relative to the date reference provided (start_date: '03/01/2018', end_date: '31/12/2021'). This means we need to consider the data from 10 months before the end_date (31/12/2021) till the end_date itself.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- DIMENSION: Map ""countries"" to the ENTITY ""Country""
- DERIVED MEASURE: Map ""percentage"" to the ENTITY ""ratio"" and include the APPLIED MEASURE ""discount percentage""
- DATE VARIABLE: Map ""last 10 months"" to the ENTITY ""Order Date"" and include the CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT ""last 10 months""

By following these steps, we have successfully converted the query into a structured output that captures all the necessary components and their relationships to the context.","{'MEASURE': {'discount %': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'countries': [{'ENTITY': 'Country', 'RANK': [{'RANK ADJECTIVE': 'top', 'RANK VALUE': '1'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'past 10 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 months'}]}}"

- In the query ""Forecast of profits in 1st quarter of last year"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Date variable: 1st quarter of last year

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: ""profits"" can be matched to the context's ""Profit"" entity, as it is listed as an alternative name.
- Date variable: ""1st quarter of last year"" can be matched to the context's ""Order Date"" entity, as it is a time-related term.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date variable ""1st quarter of last year"" needs to be converted into a structured format. We can do this by breaking it down into two parts:
  - Quarter: 1st quarter
  - Year: last year
- We can then represent this as ""quarter 1 last year"" in the structured output.

Step 4: Combine the matched components and converted date/time component into the structured output
- Finally, we can combine the matched components and the converted date/time component into the structured output:
  - Measure: {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}
  - Date variable: {'1st quarter of last year': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'quarter 1 last year'}]}","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'1st quarter': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'quarter 1 of last year'}], 'last year': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last year'}]}}"

- In the query ""How many product name contributing to growth of profits across 2 months"", we can identify the following components:
  - ""product name"" as a dimension
  - ""contributing to growth"" as a derived measure
  - ""profits"" as a measure
  - ""across 2 months"" as a date variable

Step 2: Match components to the context
- Match ""product name"" to the dimension ""Product Name"" in the context
- Match ""contributing to growth"" to the derived measure ""contribution_to_growth"" in the context
- Match ""profits"" to the measure ""Profit"" in the context

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- The date variable ""across 2 months"" needs to be converted to a more structured format. Since the query asks for data across the last 2 months, we can convert this to ""last 2 months"" and associate it with the ""Order Date"" entity in the context.

Step 4: Combine components into structured output
- Now that we have matched all components to the context and converted the date variable, we can combine them into a structured output. This includes:
  - Associating ""profits"" with the ""Profit"" entity
  - Associating ""product name"" with the ""Product Name"" entity
  - Associating ""contributing to growth"" with the ""contribution_to_growth"" derived measure and applying the ""profits"" measure to it
  - Associating ""across 2 months"" with the ""Order Date"" entity and the converted time element ""last 2 months""

  - ""first time"": Indicates a specific point in time.
  - ""profits"": Refers to the measure 'Profit'.
  - ""more than 10k"": A constraint on the measure 'Profit'.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- We can match the identified components to the context as follows:
  - ""profits"": Matches with the 'Profit' entity in the context.
  - ""first time"": Refers to the 'Order Date' entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert the measure component
- The measure component ""profits more than 10k"" can be converted into a structured output as follows:
  - ENTITY: 'Profit'
  - MEASURE CONSTRAINT: [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '10000', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]
  - ADJECTIVE: ['first']

Step 4: Convert the date/time component
- The date/time component ""first time"" can be converted into a structured output as follows:

- The query mentions ""discount"", which is a measure.
- The query mentions ""Burundi"" and ""Mali"", which are not present in the context but can be considered as filters.
- The query mentions ""March 2022"", which is a date variable.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The measure ""discount"" can be matched to the ""Discount"" entity in the context.
- The date variable ""March 2022"" can be matched to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date variable ""March 2022"" is converted to the ""Order Date"" entity with the ""CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT"" as ""March 2022"". This is done because the context provides information about the ""Order Date"" entity, and the query is asking for information in March 2022.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The measure ""discount"" is added to the structured output with the corresponding entity from the context.
- The date variable ""March 2022"" is added to the structured output with the converted time element and the corresponding entity from the context.
- The filters ""Burundi"" and ""Mali"" are not present in the context, but they can be added to the structured output as additional filters to be applied on the data.

Rationale: The query is asking for the discount of Burundi and Mali in March 2022. The context provides information about the ""Discount"" measure and the ""Order Date"" date variable. By matching the components in the query to the context and converting the date variable, we can create a structured output that represents the information requested in the query.","{'MEASURE': {'discount': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'03/22': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': '2022-03-22'}]}}"

- ""overall sale"": Filter (Low Order Priority)
- ""lowest"": Adjective
- ""15d"": Date variable

Step 2: Match components to the context
- ""share"" matches with ""ratio"" in the context under Derived Measure
- ""kenya and south korea"" matches with ""Country"" in the context under Dimension
- ""overall sale"" matches with ""Low"" in the context under Filter, with parent ""Order Priority""
- ""15d"" matches with ""Order Date"" in the context under Date Variable

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- ""15d"" is converted to ""last 15 days"" for the ""Order Date"" entity

Step 4: Structure the output
- Dimension: ""kenya and south korea"" is associated with the ""Country"" entity
- Filter: ""overall sale"" is associated with the ""Low"" entity and its parent ""Order Priority""
- Derived Measure: ""share"" is associated with the ""ratio"" entity, applied measure ""Sales"", adjective ""lowest"", and tone ""negative""
- Date Variable: ""15d"" is associated with the ""Order Date"" entity and the converted time element ""last 15 days""

Rationale: The query asks for the lowest share of sales in Kenya and South Korea compared to overall sales with low order priority within the last 15 days. The structured output captures all the components from the query and matches them to the context, including the derived measure, dimension, filter, and date variable. The date/time component is converted to a more understandable format, and the output is organized in a way that reflects the relationships between the components.","{'MEASURE': {'sales percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales', 'ADJECTIVE': ['lowest'], 'TONE': 'negative'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'kenya': [{'ENTITY': 'Country'}], 'south korea': [{'ENTITY': 'Country'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'15d': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 15 days'}]}}"

- In the query ""What is the percentage of product name for profits"", we can identify the following components:
  - ""percentage"" is a derived measure
  - ""product name"" is a dimension
  - ""profits"" is a measure

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- We can match the components to the context as follows:
  - ""percentage"" can be matched to the derived measure ""ratio"" in the context
  - ""product name"" can be matched to the dimension ""Product Name"" in the context
  - ""profits"" can be matched to the measure ""Profit"" in the context

Step 3: Create the structured output
- Based on the matched components, we can create the structured output as follows:
  - For the measure ""profits"", we add the entity ""Profit"" from the context
  - For the dimension ""product name"", we add the entity ""Product Name"" from the context
  - For the derived measure ""percentage"", we add the entity ""ratio"" from the context and also specify the applied measure as ""profits"" with the entity ""Profit""

Step 4: Handle the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}
- Since the query does not explicitly mention any date or time-related information, we can assume that the analysis should be done within the given date range.
- The date variable in the context is ""Order Date"", which can be used to filter the data within the specified date range.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'product name': [{'ENTITY': 'Product Name'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}}"

- The query asks for a list of top countries.
- It has a condition of discount percentage greater than 20000.
- The time frame is the last 10 months.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The context provides information about the entities and their other names.
- 'countries' can be matched to the 'Country' entity in the context.
- 'discount percentage' can be matched to the 'Discount percentage' entity in the context.
- 'last 10 months' can be matched to the 'Order Date' entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert the query into a structured output
- The dimension in the query is 'countries', which is matched to the 'Country' entity in the context. Since the query asks for the top countries, we include the 'RANK' information with 'RANK ADJECTIVE' as 'top' and 'RANK VALUE' as an empty string (since no specific number is mentioned in the query).
- The date variable in the query is 'last 10 months', which is matched to the 'Order Date' entity in the context. We convert this into 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' as 'last 10 months' to represent the time frame in the structured output.

Rationale:
- The query asks for a list of top countries with a specific condition on discount percentage and a time frame of the last 10 months.
- By identifying the components in the query and matching them to the context, we can create a structured output that represents the information needed to answer the query.

- In the query ""What is the profits by customer id across 3 years"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Dimension: customer id
  - Date/Time component: across 3 years

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: In the context, we find that 'profits' is an other name for the entity 'Profit'.
- Dimension: In the context, we find that 'customer id' is an other name for the entity 'Customer ID'.
- Date/Time component: In the context, we find that 'Order Date' is the date variable entity.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date/time component in the query is ""across 3 years"". Since the date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021', we can interpret ""across 3 years"" as the last 3 years from the end date. Therefore, we convert the date/time component to 'last 3 years' for the 'Order Date' entity.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date/time component, we create the structured output with the following elements:
  - MEASURE: {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}
  - DIMENSION: {'customer id': [{'ENTITY': 'Customer ID'}]}
  - DATE VARIABLE: {'3 years': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 3 years'}]}

- The query mentions ""bottom product name,"" which indicates a ranking of product names.
- ""Based on monthly trends"" suggests a time element related to months.
- ""For profits"" indicates that the measure of interest is profits.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- In the context, ""Profit"" is the measure that matches ""profits"" in the query.
- ""Product Name"" is the dimension that matches ""product name"" in the query.
- ""Order Date"" is the date variable that matches the time element in the query.

Step 3: Convert the ranking component
- The query asks for the ""bottom"" product name, which means the lowest-ranking product in terms of profits. This is represented as a rank adjective ""bottom"" and a rank value of ""1"" in the structured output.

Step 4: Convert the date/time component
- The query mentions ""monthly trends,"" which means the data should be aggregated across months. This is represented as a converted time element ""across months"" in the structured output.

Step 5: Combine the components into the structured output
- The measure ""profits"" is linked to the entity ""Profit"" from the context.
- The dimension ""product name"" is linked to the entity ""Product Name"" from the context, along with the rank adjective and rank value.
- The date variable ""monthly trends"" is linked to the entity ""Order Date"" from the context, along with the converted time element ""across months.""

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: ""sale"" matches with ""Sales"" in the context
- Dimension: ""ship mode"" matches with ""Ship Mode"" in the context
- Derived Measure: ""contributing to growth"" matches with ""contribution_to_growth"" in the context
- Date Variable: ""15d"" needs to be converted to a proper date range

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- ""15d"" refers to the last 15 days. Since the end date in the date reference is ""31/12/2021"", the last 15 days would be from ""17/12/2021"" to ""31/12/2021"". So, the date variable is converted to ""last 15 days"" for the ""Order Date"" entity.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- For each component identified in Step 1, add the corresponding entity from the context to the structured output.
- For the derived measure, also include the applied measure, which is ""Sales"" in this case.

- The date range is not explicitly mentioned in the query, so we will use the date reference provided (start_date: 03/01/2018, end_date: 31/12/2021).

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""Contribution"" can be matched to the ""DERIVED MEASURE"" entity ""ratio"" in the context.
- ""Discount"" can be matched to the ""MEASURE"" entity ""Discount"" in the context.
- The countries mentioned in the query (Burundi, Mali, Singapore, Brazil, and Netherlands) can be matched to the ""DIMENSION"" entity ""Country"" in the context.

Step 3: Create the structured output
- Since the query asks for the ""contribution"" of specific countries for ""discount,"" we need to apply the ""ratio"" derived measure to the ""Discount"" measure.
- We also need to add a constraint for the ""Country"" dimension to include only the mentioned countries (Burundi, Mali, Singapore, Brazil, and Netherlands).
- The date range is not explicitly mentioned in the query, so we will use the date reference provided (start_date: 03/01/2018, end_date: 31/12/2021) for the ""Order Date"" date variable.

Rationale:
- The query asks for the ""contribution"" of specific countries for ""discount,"" which can be interpreted as the ratio of the discount provided by these countries.
- By matching the components in the query to the context, we can create a structured output that includes the derived measure ""ratio"" applied to the ""Discount"" measure, with a constraint for the ""Country"" dimension to include only the mentioned countries.
- The date range is not explicitly mentioned in the query, so we use the date reference provided to ensure that the data is relevant for the given time period.","{'DERIVED MEASURE': {'discount contributions': [{'ENTITY': 'contribution_to_growth', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount': 'Discount'}]}]}}"

- The query mentions ""last 10 months"" and ""15d"" which are date/time components.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The measure ""discount percentage"" can be matched to the context entity ""Discount percentage"".
- The dimension ""countries"" can be matched to the context entity ""Country"".
- The date/time components ""last 10 months"" and ""15d"" can be matched to the context entity ""Order Date"".

Step 3: Convert the date/time components
- ""last 10 months"" is converted to ""last 10 months"" as a time element associated with the ""Order Date"" entity.
- ""15d"" is converted to ""last 15 days"" as a time element associated with the ""Order Date"" entity.

Rationale:
- The query is asking for a comparison of discount percentages across countries for two different time periods: the last 10 months and the last 15 days.
- By identifying the relevant components in the query and matching them to the context, we can create a structured output that accurately represents the information requested.
- Converting the date/time components ensures that the structured output is consistent and can be easily understood by a data processing system.","{'MEASURE': {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'countries': [{'ENTITY': 'Country'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'10 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 months'}], '15 days': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 15 days'}]}}"

- The date/time component ""yearly"" needs to be converted to a structured output format. Since the context provides the date variable ""Order Date"", we can use this to represent the ""yearly"" component.
- In the structured output, the ""yearly"" component is represented as {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across years'}.

Rationale:
- The query asks for the yearly discount percentage, which means we need to aggregate the discount percentage data across years.
- The context provides the ""Order Date"" entity, which can be used to represent the time component in the structured output.
- By converting the ""yearly"" component to 'across years', we ensure that the structured output captures the required aggregation of discount percentage data over time.","{'MEASURE': {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'annual': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across years'}]}}"

- Trend: Indicates a time-based analysis
- Share of cities discount: Refers to the ratio of discounts in cities
- March 2022: The specific time period for the analysis

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Trend: Matches with 'Order Date' in the context
- Share of cities discount: Matches with 'ratio' as a derived measure and 'City' as a dimension in the context
- March 2022: Falls within the date reference range (03/01/2018 to 31/12/2021)

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- March 2022: Convert this to 'March 2022' as a converted time element associated with the 'Order Date' entity in the context

Step 4: Structure the output
- DIMENSION: Include 'cities' with the 'City' entity from the context
- DERIVED MEASURE: Include 'share' with the 'ratio' entity from the context, and specify that it is applied to the 'Discount' measure. No comparison value or operator is needed in this case.
- DATE VARIABLE: Include 'march 2022' with the 'Order Date' entity and the converted time element 'March 2022'

The rationale behind this conversion is to identify the relevant components in the query, match them to the context, and structure the output accordingly. The date component is converted to match the format used in the context, and the derived measure is specified to be applied to the discount measure. This structured output allows for a clear understanding of the requested analysis and can be used to generate the desired results.","{'MEASURE': {'discount share': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount': 'Discount'}]}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'share': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount': 'Discount'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': '03/2022'}]}}"

- In the given query, we can identify the following components: ""product name"", ""contributing"", ""profits"", and ""1st quarter of last year"".

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""product name"" can be matched to the ""Product Name"" entity in the DIMENSION section of the context.
- ""contributing"" can be matched to the ""ratio"" entity in the DERIVED MEASURE section of the context.
- ""profits"" can be matched to the ""Profit"" entity in the MEASURE section of the context.
- ""1st quarter of last year"" can be matched to the ""Order Date"" entity in the DATE VARIABLE section of the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date/time component ""1st quarter of last year"" needs to be converted into a more structured format. Since the date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021', we can determine that ""last year"" refers to 2020. Therefore, ""1st quarter of last year"" can be converted to ""quarter 1 last year"".

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date/time component, we can now create the structured output. The output should include the identified MEASURE, DIMENSION, DERIVED MEASURE, and DATE VARIABLE components, along with their corresponding entities and any additional information (such as the ""APPLIED MEASURE"" for the DERIVED MEASURE component).

- The query asks for the discount percentage of countries except Germany.
- The time frame mentioned is 2.5 months.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The discount percentage can be matched to the 'Discount percentage' entity in the context.
- The countries can be matched to the 'Country' entity in the context.
- The time frame (2.5 months) needs to be converted to a suitable format for the 'Order Date' entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert the time frame
- The time frame mentioned in the query is 2.5 months. To convert this into a suitable format for the 'Order Date' entity, we can calculate the number of days in 2.5 months.
- Assuming an average of 30 days per month, 2.5 months would be equal to 2.5 * 30 = 75 days.
- Therefore, the time frame can be represented as 'last 75 days' for the 'Order Date' entity.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The 'DIMENSION' field in the structured output should include the 'Country' entity, with the exception of Germany.
- The 'DATE VARIABLE' field in the structured output should include the 'Order Date' entity, with the converted time element 'last 75 days'.

Rationale:
- The query asks for the discount percentage of countries except Germany, so the 'Country' entity is included in the 'DIMENSION' field with the exception of Germany.
- The time frame of 2.5 months is converted to 'last 75 days' to be compatible with the 'Order Date' entity in the context, and is included in the 'DATE VARIABLE' field.","{'MEASURE': {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'non-German countries': [{'ENTITY': 'Country', 'FILTER': [{'ENTITY': 'Country', 'EXCLUDE': 'Germany'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'2': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 years'}]}}"

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Bottom product name: This matches with the 'Product Name' entity in the context.
- Trend of growth rate of profits: This matches with the 'Growth Rate' entity in the context, which is a derived measure based on the 'Profit' entity.
- 1st quarter of last year: This matches with the 'Order Date' entity in the context, which is a date variable.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- 1st quarter of last year: To convert this, we need to find the date range for the first quarter of the previous year. Given the end_date in the date reference is '31/12/2021', the previous year would be 2020. Therefore, the first quarter of 2020 would have a date range from '01/01/2020' to '31/03/2020'. This is represented as 'quarter 1 last year' in the structured output.

Step 4: Structure the output

- In the query ""What is the contribution of profits for customer id across 3 years"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Dimension: customer id
  - Derived Measure: contribution
  - Date/Time component: across 3 years

Step 2: Match components to the context
- Measure: 'profits' can be matched to the 'Profit' entity in the context.
- Dimension: 'customer id' can be matched to the 'Customer ID' entity in the context.
- Derived Measure: 'contribution' can be matched to the 'ratio' entity in the context.
- Date/Time component: 'across 3 years' needs to be converted to a proper date range.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- To convert 'across 3 years' to a proper date range, we need to consider the last 3 years from the end_date '31/12/2021'.
- Subtracting 3 years from the end_date, we get the start date for the last 3 years as '01/01/2019'.
- So, the converted time element for 'across 3 years' is 'last 3 years'.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date/time component, we can create the structured output as follows:

- The query asks for the number of cities contributing to the discount. So, the main components are ""cities"" and ""contributing to discount"".

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- In the context, we have ""City"" as a dimension with other names as ""cities"". So, we can match ""cities"" from the query to this dimension.
- The context also has a derived measure ""ratio"" with other names as ""contributing"", ""contribute"". We can match ""contributing to discount"" from the query to this derived measure.

Step 3: Identify the measure to be applied
- Since the derived measure is about ""contributing to discount"", we need to identify the measure related to the discount. In the context, we have ""Discount"" as a measure with other names as ""discounts"", ""discount"". So, we can apply this measure to the derived measure ""ratio"".

Step 4: Consider the date/time component
- The date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'. However, the query does not specifically mention any date or time-related information. Therefore, we can assume that the query is asking for the number of cities contributing to the discount within the given date range.

- Discount percentage: Matches with the 'Discount percentage' entity in the context
- Furnishing: Matches with the 'Furnishings' entity in the context
- Order Date: Matches with the 'Order Date' entity in the context

Step 3: Convert the query into structured output
- DIMENSION: Identify the dimension as 'Sub-Category' and add the ranking information (bottom, rank value 1)
- FILTER: Identify the filter as 'Furnishings' with parent 'Sub-Category'
- DERIVED MEASURE: Identify the derived measure as 'correlation' with the applied measure 'Discount percentage' and ratio filter 'Furnishings'
- DATE VARIABLE: Identify the date variable as 'Order Date' and convert the time element to 'last quarter'

Rationale:
- The query asks for the bottom sub-category, which indicates a ranking on the dimension 'Sub-Category'.
- The correlation of discount percentage is a derived measure that needs to be calculated between Guinea and Furnishing, so we add a filter for 'Furnishings' and a ratio filter in the derived measure.
- The time component in the query is 'previous quarter', which is converted to 'last quarter' in the structured output for the 'Order Date' entity.","{'DIMENSION': {'subcategory': [{'ENTITY': 'Sub-Category'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'correlation': [{'ENTITY': 'correlation', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount percentage': 'Discount percentage'}], 'ADJECTIVE': ['lowest'], 'TONE': 'negative'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'previous quarter': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last quarter'}]}}"

- ""discount percentage contribution"" matches to the ""ratio"" entity in the context under DERIVED MEASURE. Since it is related to ""discount percentage"", we need to match it to the ""Discount percentage"" entity in the context under MEASURE.
- ""> 50k"" is a comparison constraint that needs to be applied to the derived measure.

Step 3: Handle the date/time component
- The date reference is given as {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}. However, the query does not mention any specific date or time-related information. Therefore, we do not need to include the date reference in the structured output.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- DIMENSION: Include the matched ""Sub-Category"" entity.
- DERIVED MEASURE: Include the matched ""ratio"" entity, and specify that it is applied to the ""Discount percentage"" measure. Also, include the comparison constraint ""> 50k"".

- In the query ""Why profits of el salvador changed in 1st quarter of last year"", we can identify the following components:
  - Profits: Measure
  - El Salvador: Filter (not mentioned in the context, but can be inferred)
  - Changed: Derived Measure (Growth Rate)
  - 1st quarter of last year: Date Variable

Step 2: Match components to the context
- Profits: Matched to 'Profit' in the context under 'MEASURE'
- Changed: Matched to 'Growth Rate' in the context under 'DERIVED MEASURE'
- 1st quarter of last year: Matched to 'Order Date' in the context under 'DATE VARIABLE'

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- The date component ""1st quarter of last year"" is converted to 'quarter 1 last year' in the structured output. This is done by understanding that ""1st quarter"" refers to the first quarter of a year and ""last year"" refers to the previous year. Combining these two pieces of information, we get 'quarter 1 last year' as the converted time element.

Step 4: Create structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date/time component, the structured output is created with the following structure:
  - MEASURE: {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}
  - DERIVED MEASURE: {'why': [{'ENTITY': 'why'}], 'changed': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}
  - DATE VARIABLE: {'1st quarter of last year': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'quarter 1 last year'}]}

The rationale behind this structured output is to represent the query in a format that can be easily understood and processed by a data analysis system.

- The query mentions ""cities"" which can be matched to the ""City"" entity in the context.
- The query mentions ""discount greater than 20000"" which can be matched to the ""Discount"" entity in the context and a comparison constraint.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The ""cities"" in the query can be matched to the ""City"" entity in the context under the DIMENSION category.
- The ""discount greater than 20000"" in the query can be matched to the ""Discount"" entity in the context under the MEASURE category, with a comparison constraint of '>' and a comparison value of '20000'.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- The query does not mention any specific date or time-related keywords, so the date reference will be applied as a default filter for the data.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""Customer ID"" matches the dimension entity ""Customer ID"" in the context.
- ""profits"" matches the measure entity ""Profit"" in the context.
- ""across 3 years"" matches the date variable entity ""Order Date"" in the context.

Step 3: Determine the ranking and ranking value
- The query mentions ""top,"" which indicates a ranking adjective.
- Since no specific rank value is mentioned, we assume a default rank value of ""1.""

Step 4: Convert the date/time component
- The query mentions ""across 3 years,"" which needs to be converted to a time element.
- Given the date reference, we can determine that the time element should be ""across years"" to cover the entire date range from 03/01/2018 to 31/12/2021.

Step 5: Structure the output
- The measure ""profits"" is associated with the entity ""Profit.""
- The dimension ""customer id"" is associated with the entity ""Customer ID"" and the ranking information (top and rank value 1).

- Measure: Profit
- Derived Measure: Ratio (share) applied to Profit
- Date Variable: Order Date with a converted time element of ""last 3 years""

Rationale:
The query asks for the top customer id based on the share of profits across 3 years. To answer this, we need to identify the relevant dimensions, measures, and date variables from the context. We found Customer ID as the dimension, Profit as the measure, and Order Date as the date variable. We also identified the derived measure Ratio (share) to be applied to Profit. The date component ""across 3 years"" is converted to ""last 3 years"" to represent the time period before the end date in the date reference.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Ship Mode: Found in the context under DIMENSION
- Correlation: Found in the context under DERIVED MEASURE
- Sale: Found in the context under MEASURE (Sales)
- Discounts: Found in the context under MEASURE (Discount)

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- 15d: The query asks for the top ship mode based on correlation between sale and discounts in 15 days. This can be interpreted as the last 15 days from the end date provided in the date reference. So, we convert '15d' to 'last 15 days' considering the end date '31/12/2021'.

Step 4: Structure the output
- DIMENSION: Include Ship Mode and specify the ranking (top 1)
- DERIVED MEASURE: Include correlation and apply the measures (Sales and Discount)
- DATE VARIABLE: Include Order Date and the converted time element (last 15 days)

- The query mentions ""discount percentage"" which is a measure.
- The query mentions ""first time"" which indicates a date variable.
- The query mentions ""previous quarter"" which is a date constraint.
- The query mentions ""> 50k"" which is a measure constraint.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""Discount percentage"" can be matched to the context as {'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage', 'other names': ['discount percentage'], 'dataset_id': '6538e14185a957419006d762'}.
- ""Order Date"" is the date variable in the context, which can be used for the ""first time"" component.
- There is no direct match for ""previous quarter"" in the context, but it can be derived from the date reference provided.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- The query asks for the ""previous quarter"", which means we need to find the last quarter in the date reference.
- To find the last quarter, we can look at the end_date '31/12/2021' and determine that it falls in the fourth quarter of 2021.
- Therefore, the ""previous quarter"" can be converted to {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last quarter'}.

Step 4: Structure the output
- The measure component is structured as {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '50k', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}]}.
- The date variable component is structured as {'previous quarter': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last quarter'}]}.

- The query asks to list ship mode based on monthly trends. So, the main components are ""ship mode"" and ""monthly trends"".

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- In the context, we have a dimension called ""Ship Mode"" with an alternative name ""ship mode"". This matches the ""ship mode"" component in the query.
- For the ""monthly trends"" component, we have a date variable called ""Order Date"" with an alternative name ""trend"". This matches the date/time component in the query.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is from 03/01/2018 to 31/12/2021. Since the query asks for monthly trends, we need to convert the ""Order Date"" variable into a monthly format. This is done by adding the ""CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT"" attribute with the value ""across months"" to the ""Order Date"" entity.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date/time component, we create the structured output with the ""DIMENSION"" and ""DATE VARIABLE"" keys. The ""DIMENSION"" key contains the ""ship mode"" entity, and the ""DATE VARIABLE"" key contains the ""monthly trends"" entity with the converted time element.

Rationale:
- The query asks for ship mode based on monthly trends, so we need to identify the relevant dimension and date variable from the context.
- We matched the ""ship mode"" component to the ""Ship Mode"" dimension in the context and the ""monthly trends"" component to the ""Order Date"" date variable.

- Trend: Indicates a time-based analysis
- Ratio of discount: A derived measure involving the discount
- Burundi to Mali: Entities to be compared
- Across 2 months: Time element for the trend

Step 2: Match components to the context
- Trend: Matches with 'Order Date' in the context under 'DATE VARIABLE'
- Ratio of discount: Matches with 'ratio' in the context under 'DERIVED MEASURE' and 'Discount' under 'MEASURE'
- Burundi and Mali: Not explicitly mentioned in the context, but can be inferred as part of the data
- Across 2 months: Time element to be applied on 'Order Date'

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- Across 2 months: This time element is applied to the 'Order Date' entity, which is then converted to 'across 2 months' in the structured output.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- DERIVED MEASURE: The 'ratio' entity is created with the applied measure 'Discount' from the context.
- DATE VARIABLE: The 'trend' entity is created with the converted time element 'across 2 months' applied to the 'Order Date' entity.

Rationale: The query asks for the trend of the ratio of discount between Burundi and Mali over a period of 2 months. The structured output captures this by including the derived measure 'ratio' with the applied measure 'Discount', and the date variable 'trend' with the converted time element 'across 2 months'.

- ""product name"" is a dimension
- ""contributing"" is a derived measure
- ""profits"" is a measure
- ""across 2 months"" is a date variable

Step 2: Match components to the context
- ""product name"" matches the entity ""Product Name"" in the context
- ""contributing"" matches the entity ""ratio"" in the context
- ""profits"" matches the entity ""Profit"" in the context
- ""across 2 months"" matches the entity ""Order Date"" in the context

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- ""across 2 months"" is converted to ""last 2 months"" as it refers to a time period relative to the current date. Since the end_date in the date reference is '31/12/2021', the last 2 months would be November and December 2021.

Rationale:
- The query asks for the number of product names contributing to profits in a specific time period (2 months). Therefore, it is essential to identify the dimension (product name), measure (profits), derived measure (contributing), and date variable (across 2 months) in the query.
- Matching these components to the context ensures that the structured output accurately represents the information requested in the query.
- Converting the date/time component to ""last 2 months"" allows for a clear understanding of the time period being referred to, which is crucial for accurate data analysis.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'product name': [{'ENTITY': 'Product Name'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'contributing': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'2-month span': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 months'}]}}"

- The query asks for the ""yearly trend"" which is a date variable component.
- It mentions ""discount percentage"" which is a measure component.
- The query specifies ""for guinea"" which is a filter component.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The ""discount percentage"" component can be matched to the ""Discount percentage"" entity in the context.
- The ""yearly trend"" component can be matched to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context, as it is the only date variable available.
- The ""for guinea"" component is not explicitly mentioned in the context, but it can be assumed that it is a filter component.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The ""yearly trend"" component needs to be converted to a structured output format. Since the query asks for the trend across years, the ""Order Date"" entity should be converted to ""across years"".

Rationale:
- The query asks for the yearly trend of discount percentage, which means we need to analyze the discount percentage data across years.
- The context provides the ""Order Date"" entity as the only date variable, so we can use it to calculate the yearly trend.
- By converting the ""Order Date"" entity to ""across years"", we can analyze the discount percentage data on a yearly basis, as required by the query.","{'MEASURE': {'discount trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount', 'ADJECTIVE': ['annual']}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'trend'}]}}"

Step 3: Create the structured output
- For the derived measure 'share', we add the entity 'ratio' and specify that it is applied to the measure 'discount' (from the context).
- Add the adjective 'highest' to the derived measure 'share' and set the tone as 'positive' since it is asking for the highest value.
- For the date variable 'when', we add the entity 'Order Date' from the context.

Step 4: Incorporate the date reference
- The date reference provided (start_date: '03/01/2018', end_date: '31/12/2021') is not explicitly mentioned in the query, but it can be assumed that the query is asking for the highest share of discount within this date range. Therefore, the structured output should consider this date range when analyzing the data.

Rationale:
- The query is asking for the time when the share of discount was highest in Burundi. To answer this, we need to identify the derived measure (share of discount), the filter (Burundi), and the date variable (when).
- By matching these components to the context, we can create a structured output that accurately represents the query and considers the given date range.","{'DERIVED MEASURE': {'discount share': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount': 'Discount'}], 'ADJECTIVE': ['max'], 'TONE': 'positive'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'when': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date'}]}}"

- Top customer id: Dimension (Customer ID) with a ranking
- Share of profits: Derived Measure (ratio) applied to Measure (Profit)
- Across 3 years: Date Variable (Order Date) with a time element

Step 2: Match components to the context
- Customer ID: Found in the context as {'ENTITY': 'Customer ID', 'other names': ['customer id']}
- Profit: Found in the context as {'ENTITY': 'Profit', 'other names': ['profits']}
- Ratio: Found in the context as {'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'other names': ['share']}
- Order Date: Found in the context as {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'other names': ['date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', 'order date']}

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- ""Across 3 years"" is converted to ""last 3 years"" as it refers to a period of 3 years before the end date in the date reference (31/12/2021).

Step 4: Structure the output
- Dimension: Customer ID with a ranking of top 1
- Measure: Profit
- Derived Measure: Ratio (share) applied to Profit
- Date Variable: Order Date with a converted time element of ""last 3 years""

Rationale:
The query asks for the top customer id based on the share of profits across 3 years. To answer this, we need to identify the relevant dimensions, measures, and date variables from the context. We found Customer ID as the dimension, Profit as the measure, and Order Date as the date variable. We also identified the derived measure Ratio (share) to be applied to Profit. The date component ""across 3 years"" is converted to ""last 3 years"" to represent the time period before the end date in the date reference. Finally, we structured the output with the identified components and their respective attributes.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'customer id': [{'ENTITY': 'Customer ID', 'RANK': [{'RANK ADJECTIVE': 'top', 'RANK VALUE': '1'}]}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'profit share': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'over 3 yrs': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 3 years'}]}}"

- In the given query, we can identify the following components: ""contribution"", ""el salvador"", ""overall profits"", ""1st quarter"", and ""last year"".

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""contribution"" can be matched to the derived measure ""ratio"" with the other name ""contribution"".
- ""overall profits"" can be matched to the measure ""Profit"" with the other name ""profits"".
- ""1st quarter of last year"" can be matched to the date variable ""Order Date"" with other names including ""date"", ""when"", ""yoy"", ""trend"", ""mom"", ""time"", and ""order date"".

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date component ""1st quarter of last year"" can be converted to ""quarter 1 last year"" as it refers to the first quarter of the previous year.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date component, we can create the structured output as follows:
  - MEASURE: {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}
  - DERIVED MEASURE: {'contribution': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}
  - DATE VARIABLE: {'1st quarter of last year': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'quarter 1 last year'}]}

Rationale:
- The query asks for the contribution of a specific country (El Salvador) to overall profits in a specific time period (1st quarter of last year). 
- We matched the components in the query to the context provided and converted the date component accordingly.
- The structured output represents the required information to answer the query, including the measure (profits), derived measure (contribution), and date variable (1st quarter of last year).","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'contribution': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'1st quarter previous year': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'quarter 1 last year'}]}}"
Kenya sales forecast for the next 15 days?,Forecast of sale for kenya in 15d,forecast,"{'MEASURE': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales', 'other names': ['sale', 'sales']}], 'DIMENSION': [], 'FILTER': [], 'DERIVED MEASURE': [{'ENTITY': 'why', 'other names': ['reason for']}], 'DATE VARIABLE': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'other names': ['date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', 'order date']}]}","{'MEASURE': {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'15d': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 15 days'}]}}","Step 1: Identify components in the query
- In the query ""Forecast of sale for kenya in 15d"", we can identify the following components:
  1. ""Forecast of sale"" refers to the measure 'Sales'.
  2. ""kenya"" is a location, but it is not mentioned in the context, so we cannot match it to any context component.
  3. ""15d"" refers to a date/time component.

Step 2: Match components to the context
- We can match the ""Forecast of sale"" component to the 'Sales' entity in the context, as it is mentioned in the 'other names' list.
- As mentioned earlier, ""kenya"" cannot be matched to any context component.
- The ""15d"" component needs to be converted to a date/time component that can be matched to the 'Order Date' entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- The ""15d"" component can be interpreted as ""last 15 days"" or ""next 15 days"" depending on the context. Since the query is about forecasting sales, it is more appropriate to consider it as ""next 15 days"".
- We can now match the converted ""15d"" component to the 'Order Date' entity in the context.

Step 4: Create structured output
- Based on the matched components, we can create the structured output as follows:
  1. 'MEASURE': {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}
  2. 'DATE VARIABLE': {'15d': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 15 days'}]}

The rationale behind this conversion is to identify the relevant components in the query, match them to the context, and convert the date/time component to a format that can be matched to the context. This allows us to create a structured output that represents the query in a more structured and machine-readable format.","{'MEASURE': {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'next 15 days': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 15 days'}]}}"

- The query mentions ""List of cities"" which corresponds to the ""City"" entity in the context.
- The query also mentions ""contributing to discount"" which indicates a derived measure involving the ""Discount"" entity in the context.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The ""City"" entity in the query matches the ""City"" entity in the context with other names as ""cities"".
- The ""contributing"" term in the query matches the ""ratio"" entity in the context with other names as ""contributing"".
- The ""discount"" term in the query matches the ""Discount"" entity in the context with other names as ""discounts"" and ""discount"".

Step 3: Create the structured output
- For the ""DIMENSION"" part, we include the ""City"" entity as it is mentioned in the query as ""cities"".
- For the ""DERIVED MEASURE"" part, we include the ""ratio"" entity and specify that it is applied to the ""Discount"" entity as mentioned in the query.

Step 4: Handle the date/time component
- The date reference is given as {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- The context mentions the ""Order Date"" entity with other names such as ""date"", ""when"", ""yoy"", ""trend"", ""mom"", ""time"", and ""order date"".
- Since the query does not explicitly mention any date-related term, we can assume that the date reference applies to the ""Order Date"" entity.
- The structured output should consider the date reference for the ""Order Date"" entity while processing the data.","{'MEASURE': {'discounts': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City'}]}}"

- The query asks for the ""monthly discount"" which indicates the measure 'Discount' and a time element 'monthly'.
- The query also mentions ""Burundi"" which is not present in the context, so it will not be included in the structured output.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The measure 'Discount' can be matched to the 'ENTITY' in the context with 'other names' as ['discount'].
- The date variable 'Order Date' can be matched to the 'ENTITY' in the context with 'other names' as ['date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', 'order date'].

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query asks for the ""monthly discount"", which means we need to convert the 'Order Date' variable to represent data across months. This is done by adding the 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' as 'across months' to the 'Order Date' entity in the structured output.

Rationale:
- The query asks for the monthly discount, so we need to include the measure 'Discount' and convert the date variable 'Order Date' to represent data across months.
- Since ""Burundi"" is not present in the context, it is not included in the structured output.","{'MEASURE': {'discount': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'monthly': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across months'}]}}"

- In the query ""Forecast of profits in 1st quarter of last year"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Date variable: 1st quarter of last year

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: ""profits"" can be matched to the context's ""Profit"" entity, as it is listed as an alternative name.
- Date variable: ""1st quarter of last year"" can be matched to the context's ""Order Date"" entity, as it is a time-related term.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date variable ""1st quarter of last year"" needs to be converted into a structured format. We can do this by breaking it down into two parts:
  - Quarter: 1st quarter
  - Year: last year
- We can then represent this as ""quarter 1 last year"" in the structured output.

Step 4: Combine the matched components and converted date/time component into the structured output
- Finally, we can combine the matched components and the converted date/time component into the structured output:

  - DATE VARIABLE: {'monthly trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across months'}]}

Rationale:
- The query asks for the monthly trend of the share of profits for each product name. To answer this, we need to analyze the data across months (date variable) and calculate the ratio (derived measure) of profits (measure) for each product name (dimension). The structured output captures this information by linking the identified components to their corresponding entities in the context and specifying the required time element for the date variable.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'product name': [{'ENTITY': 'Product Name'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'share': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across months'}]}}"

- The query asks for the growth rate of discount percentage.
- It specifies the lowest growth rate.
- It asks for the time when this lowest growth rate occurred.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Growth rate is a derived measure in the context.
- Discount percentage is a measure in the context.
- Order Date is a date variable in the context.

Step 3: Create the structured output
- The derived measure is the growth rate, and it is applied to the discount percentage measure. The adjective ""lowest"" is added to indicate that we are looking for the lowest growth rate, and the tone is set to ""negative"" since a low growth rate is generally considered unfavorable.
- The date variable is the Order Date, which will be used to determine when the lowest growth rate occurred.

Step 4: Incorporate the date reference
- The date reference provided (start_date: '03/01/2018', end_date: '31/12/2021') is not explicitly mentioned in the query, but it can be assumed that the analysis should be performed within this date range. This information can be added to the structured output if needed, but it is not required for the conversion process.

Rationale:
- The query is asking for the time when the growth rate of discount percentage was lowest. To answer this, we need to calculate the growth rate of discount percentage and find the lowest value within the given date range.

- The query mentions ""Forecast"", which indicates a prediction is required.
- ""monthly discount"" refers to the measure 'Discount' and the time element 'monthly'.
- ""Burundi"" is a location, but it is not mentioned in the context, so we can ignore it for now.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""discount"" can be matched to the 'Discount' entity in the context under 'MEASURE'.
- ""monthly"" is a time element that needs to be matched with the 'Order Date' entity in the context under 'DATE VARIABLE'.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'.
- The query asks for a ""monthly"" forecast, so we need to convert the 'Order Date' entity to represent data across months.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The 'MEASURE' component in the output is represented by the 'Discount' entity.
- The 'DATE VARIABLE' component in the output is represented by the 'Order Date' entity, with the 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' set to 'across months'.","{'MEASURE': {'discount': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'monthly': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across months'}]}}"

- The query asks for a ""List of cities and region"". This indicates that the required output should include information about cities and regions.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- In the context, we have two dimensions: City (with other names: cities) and Region (with other names: regions, region). These dimensions match the components identified in the query.

Step 3: Create the structured output
- Since the query asks for a list of cities and regions, we need to include both dimensions in the structured output. Therefore, we create a dictionary with the key 'DIMENSION' and the values 'cities' and 'region', each containing the corresponding ENTITY from the context.

Step 4: Consider the date/time component
- The date reference provided in the context is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}. However, the query does not mention any specific date or time-related information. Therefore, we do not need to include the date/time component in the structured output.

Rationale:
- The query asks for a list of cities and regions, which are both dimensions in the context. By including these dimensions in the structured output, we ensure that the output will contain the required information.
- The date/time component is not mentioned in the query, so it is not necessary to include it in the structured output.","{'DIMENSION': {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City'}], 'region': [{'ENTITY': 'Region'}]}}"

- The query asks for the time when the growth rate of profits was lowest. So, we have the following components:
  - Growth rate (derived measure)
  - Profits (measure)
  - Lowest (adjective)
  - When (date variable)

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- From the context, we can match the following components:
  - Growth Rate: {'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'other names': ['growth rate', 'growth']}
  - Profit: {'ENTITY': 'Profit', 'other names': ['profits']}
  - Low: {'ENTITY': 'Low', 'other names': ['low'], 'parent': 'Order Priority'}
  - Order Date: {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'other names': ['when']}

Step 3: Create the structured output
- For the derived measure, we need to include the growth rate and its applied measure (profits), along with the adjective (lowest) and the tone (negative) since it's asking for the lowest growth rate.
- For the date variable, we need to include the order date entity as 'when'.

Step 4: Combine the structured output
- Combine the derived measure and date variable components into a single structured output. This output now represents the query in a structured format that can be used for further processing or analysis.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'growth rate': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}], 'ADJECTIVE': ['least'], 'TONE': 'negative'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'when': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date'}]}}"

- In the query ""How many ship mode are contributing to sale"", we can identify the following components:
  - Ship mode: Dimension
  - Contributing: Derived Measure
  - Sale: Measure

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Ship mode: In the context, we can find ""Ship Mode"" under the 'DIMENSION' category with the other name ""ship mode"".
- Contributing: In the context, we can find ""ratio"" under the 'DERIVED MEASURE' category with the other names ""contributing"" and ""contribute"".
- Sale: In the context, we can find ""Sales"" under the 'MEASURE' category with the other name ""sale"".

Step 3: Create the structured output
- For the 'DIMENSION' component, we map ""ship mode"" to {'ship mode': [{'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode'}]}.
- For the 'MEASURE' component, we map ""sale"" to {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}.
- For the 'DERIVED MEASURE' component, we map ""contributing"" to {'contributing': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'sale': 'Sales'}]}]}.

Step 4: Handle the date/time component
- The date reference is given as {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- In the context, we can find ""Order Date"" under the 'DATE VARIABLE' category with other names like ""date"", ""when"", ""yoy"", ""trend"", ""mom"", ""time"", and ""order date"".
- Since the query does not explicitly mention any date-related information, we can assume that the analysis should be done within the given date range. The date range will be applied to the 'Order Date' variable in the analysis.

Rationale:
- The query asks for the number of ship modes contributing to sales. We identified the relevant components in the query and matched them to the context.
- We created the structured output by mapping the identified components to their corresponding entities in the context.
- We considered the given date range for the analysis, as the query does not explicitly mention any date-related information.","{'MEASURE': {'sales': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'ship mode': [{'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'contributing': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'sales': 'Sales'}]}]}}"

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Ship Mode: Found in the context under 'DIMENSION'
- Ratio: Found in the context under 'DERIVED MEASURE'
- Kenya and South Korea: Not directly found in the context, but can be inferred as countries under 'DIMENSION' (Country)
- Sale: Found in the context under 'MEASURE' (Sales)
- Order Date: Found in the context under 'DATE VARIABLE'

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- ""Across 3 months"" is converted to ""last 3 months"" for the 'Order Date' entity in the structured output. This is because the query is asking for data within a 3-month time frame, and the context provides a date range from 03/01/2018 to 31/12/2021. The ""last 3 months"" conversion is appropriate as it captures the most recent 3-month period within the given date range.

Step 4: Structure the output
- The identified components are organized into their respective categories (MEASURE, DIMENSION, DERIVED MEASURE, and DATE VARIABLE) in the structured output.
- The ranking information (top ship mode) is added to the 'Ship Mode' entity under 'DIMENSION' as 'RANK' with 'RANK ADJECTIVE' as 'top' and 'RANK VALUE' as '1'.

- Share of discount percentage: Matched to the entity 'ratio' in the context, applied to the measure 'Discount percentage'
- Across 2 months: Matched to the entity 'Order Date' in the context

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- Across 2 months: Convert the time element to 'last 2 months' for the entity 'Order Date'

Rationale:
- The query asks for the bottom sub category based on the share of discount percentage, so we need to identify the dimension (Sub-Category) and apply a rank (bottom) to it.
- The share of discount percentage is a derived measure, which is the ratio applied to the measure discount percentage.
- The time element in the query is ""across 2 months"", which needs to be converted to a more specific time frame, such as ""last 2 months"", and applied to the date variable (Order Date).","{'MEASURE': {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'sub-category': [{'ENTITY': 'Sub-Category', 'RANK': [{'RANK ADJECTIVE': 'smallest', 'RANK VALUE': '1'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'2-month period': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 months'}]}}"

- In the query ""When was sale lowest"", we can identify the following components:
  - ""sale"" refers to the measure 'Sales'
  - ""lowest"" refers to the filter 'Low'
  - ""when"" refers to the date variable 'Order Date'

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Match ""sale"" to the measure 'Sales' in the context
- Match ""lowest"" to the filter 'Low' in the context, which has a parent 'Order Priority'
- Match ""when"" to the date variable 'Order Date' in the context

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}
- The query asks for ""when"" the sale was lowest, which refers to the 'Order Date'
- Since the date range is provided, we can assume that the query is asking for the lowest sale within this date range

- The query asks for the ""yearly trend"" which is a date/time component.
- It mentions ""share of envelopes"" which is a derived measure.
- The measure involved is ""profits"".
- There is a filter for ""envelopes"".

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The context provides the entity ""Profit"" which matches the measure ""profits"" in the query.
- The context provides the entity ""Envelopes"" which matches the filter ""envelopes"" in the query.
- The context provides the entity ""ratio"" which matches the derived measure ""share"" in the query.
- The context provides the entity ""Order Date"" which matches the date/time component ""yearly trend"" in the query.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query asks for the ""yearly trend"" which means we need to aggregate the data across years.
- The context provides the entity ""Order Date"" which can be used to aggregate the data across years.
- The date reference is given as {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}, so we need to consider data within this range.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The measure ""profits"" is mapped to the entity ""Profit"" in the context.
- The filter ""envelopes"" is mapped to the entity ""Envelopes"" with a parent ""Sub-Category"" in the context.
- The derived measure ""share"" is mapped to the entity ""ratio"" in the context, with a ratio filter for ""envelopes"" and applied measure ""profits"".
- The date/time component ""yearly trend"" is mapped to the entity ""Order Date"" with a converted time element ""across years"" in the context.

Rationale: The structured output is created by identifying the components in the query, matching them to the context, converting the date/time component, and mapping the components to their corresponding entities in the context.

- Growth rate: {'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'other names': ['growth rate', 'growth']}
- Discount percentage: {'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage', 'other names': ['discount percentage'], 'dataset_id': '6538e14185a957419006d762'}
- Haiti: Not in the context, but we can assume it's a location filter
- Last 10 months: {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'other names': ['date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', 'order date']}

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- Last 10 months: Since the end date is '31/12/2021', we can calculate the start date for the last 10 months by subtracting 10 months from the end date. This gives us a start date of '01/03/2021'. So, the date range for the last 10 months is {'start_date': '01/03/2021', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- DERIVED MEASURE: We have the growth rate applied to the discount percentage, so we create a nested structure with the growth rate entity and the applied measure (discount percentage).
- DATE VARIABLE: We use the converted time element 'last 10 months' and associate it with the 'Order Date' entity.

Rationale: The query asks for the growth rate of discount percentage for Haiti in the last 10 months. We identified the relevant components in the query and matched them to the context. We then converted the date/time component to a specific date range and created the structured output accordingly.","{'DERIVED MEASURE': {'growth rate': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount percentage': 'Discount percentage'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'past 10 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 months'}]}}"

- Share of Kenya to overall sale: This is a derived measure (ratio) that needs to be calculated.
- Lowest: This is an adjective describing the derived measure (share).
- Across 3 months: This is a time element related to the date variable (Order Date).

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Share of Kenya to overall sale: This can be matched to the derived measure 'ratio' in the context, with the applied measure 'Sales'.
- Lowest: This can be matched to the adjective 'lowest' in the context, with a negative tone.
- Across 3 months: This can be matched to the date variable 'Order Date' in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The time element ""across 3 months"" needs to be converted and associated with the date variable 'Order Date'. This can be done by adding the 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' attribute to the 'Order Date' entity in the structured output.

Rationale:
The query asks for the time when the share of Kenya to overall sales was the lowest across a 3-month period. To answer this, we need to calculate the derived measure (ratio) of Kenya's sales to overall sales, find the lowest value of this ratio, and identify the corresponding time period. The structured output captures this information by including the derived measure (share) with the applied measure (Sales), the adjective (lowest) with a negative tone, and the date variable (Order Date) with the converted time element (across 3 months).","{'MEASURE': {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'share': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'sale': 'Sales'}], 'ADJECTIVE': ['smallest'], 'TONE': 'negative'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'when': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 3 months'}]}}"

- The query asks for the ""contribution of discount"" which can be matched to the 'ratio' entity in the DERIVED MEASURE section of the context.
- The query also mentions ""for cities"" which can be matched to the 'City' entity in the DIMENSION section of the context.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The 'ratio' entity in the DERIVED MEASURE section is matched with the 'contribution' keyword in the query.
- The 'City' entity in the DIMENSION section is matched with the 'cities' keyword in the query.

Step 3: Create the structured output
- For the DIMENSION, we include the 'City' entity as {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City'}]}.
- For the DERIVED MEASURE, we include the 'ratio' entity and specify that it is applied to the 'Discount' measure as {'contribution': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount': 'Discount'}]}]}.

Step 4: Consider the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- The query does not explicitly mention any date or time-related keywords, so we assume that the analysis should be done within the given date range.
- The DATE VARIABLE section in the context provides the 'Order Date' entity, which can be used to filter the data based on the given date range.

- List of cities: This is a dimension component, referring to the 'City' entity in the context.
- Except guinea bissau: This is a filter component, excluding a specific city from the list.
- Across 2 months: This is a date variable component, referring to a time period of 2 months.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- 'City' entity in the context has other names as 'cities', which matches the 'List of cities' component in the query.
- There is no direct match for 'except guinea bissau' in the context, but it can be inferred as a filter component.
- 'Order Date' entity in the context has other names like 'date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', 'order date', which can be related to the 'across 2 months' component in the query.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The 'across 2 months' component in the query can be converted to 'last 2 months' as it refers to a time period of 2 months. This is added as a 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' to the 'Order Date' entity in the structured output.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The 'DIMENSION' key in the structured output is populated with the 'cities' component, which is linked to the 'City' entity in the context.
- The 'DATE VARIABLE' key in the structured output is populated with the 'across 2 months' component, which is linked to the 'Order Date' entity in the context and has the 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' as 'last 2 months'.

Rationale: The query is asking for a list of cities, excluding guinea bissau, across a time period of 2 months. The structured output is created by identifying the relevant components in the query, matching them to the context, converting the date/time component, and organizing them into a structured format.","{'DIMENSION': {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'2 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 months'}]}}"

- In the query ""Why discount percentage of haiti and central asia changed in last 10 months"", we can identify the following components:
  - Derived Measure: ""why"" and ""changed""
  - Filter: ""haiti"" and ""central asia""
  - Date Variable: ""last 10 months""

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- From the context, we can match the following components:
  - Derived Measure: ""why"" and ""changed"" can be matched to ""why"" and ""Growth Rate"" respectively.
  - Filter: ""haiti"" and ""central asia"" are not explicitly mentioned in the context, but they can be considered as filters for the analysis.
  - Date Variable: ""last 10 months"" can be matched to ""Order Date"" with a specific time constraint.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date component ""last 10 months"" needs to be converted into a structured format. Since the end date in the date reference is '31/12/2021', we can calculate the start date for the last 10 months as '01/03/2021'. This will be used as a constraint for the ""Order Date"" entity.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date/time component, we can create the structured output as follows:
  - For Derived Measure, we include ""why"" and ""changed"" entities with their respective constraints.
  - For Date Variable, we include the ""Order Date"" entity with the converted time element ""last 10 months"".

Rationale:
- The query asks for an analysis of the change in discount percentage for haiti and central asia in the last 10 months. To answer this, we need to consider the derived measures ""why"" and ""changed"" (Growth Rate) and apply filters for the specified regions. Additionally, we need to consider the date variable ""Order Date"" with a specific time constraint of the last 10 months. By matching these components to the context and converting the date/time component, we can create a structured output that captures the required information for the analysis.","{'DERIVED MEASURE': {'why': [{'ENTITY': 'why'}], 'ratio': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount percentage': 'Discount percentage'}]}], 'Growth Rate': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount percentage': 'Discount percentage'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'past 10 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 months'}]}}"

Step 3: Identify the date/time component
- The date reference is given as {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.

Step 4: Convert the query into a structured output
- The measure ""sale"" is associated with a constraint: ""sale is > 50k"". This constraint is added to the structured output as a MEASURE CONSTRAINT with a COMPARISON VALUE of '50k' and a COMPARISON OPERATOR of '>'.
- The dimension ""ship mode"" is added to the structured output as an ENTITY under DIMENSION.
- The date reference is not explicitly mentioned in the query, but it can be assumed that the query is asking for the data within the given date range. Therefore, the date reference is implicitly applied to the structured output.

Rationale:
- The query is asking for the number of ship modes where the sales are greater than 50k. This requires identifying the dimension (ship mode) and the measure (sale) along with the condition (> 50k).
- The context provides the necessary information to match the components in the query to their corresponding entities.
- The date reference is not explicitly mentioned in the query, but it is assumed that the query is asking for the data within the given date range.","{'MEASURE': {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '50k', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'ship mode': [{'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode'}]}}"

  - Ship mode (Dimension)
  - Sale contribution (Derived Measure)
  - 50k (Comparison Value)
  - '>' (Comparison Operator)

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Ship mode: In the context, we can find ""Ship Mode"" under the 'DIMENSION' key with the alternative name ""ship mode"".
- Sale contribution: In the context, we can find ""ratio"" under the 'DERIVED MEASURE' key with the alternative name ""contribution"".
- 50k: This is a comparison value and does not need to be matched to the context.
- '>': This is a comparison operator and does not need to be matched to the context.

Step 3: Identify the measure associated with the derived measure
- In the context, we can see that the derived measure ""ratio"" (or ""contribution"") is associated with the measure ""Sales"" under the 'MEASURE' key with the alternative name ""sale"".

Step 4: Incorporate the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}. Since the query does not mention any specific date or time-related constraints, we can assume that the query is to be executed within this date range.

- The query asks for a ""List of cities and region""
- The time reference given is ""in March 2022""

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The context provides information about the entities 'City' and 'Region' under the 'DIMENSION' category. The other names for 'City' are 'cities', and for 'Region' are 'regions' and 'region'.
- The context also provides information about the 'Order Date' entity under the 'DATE VARIABLE' category, with other names such as 'date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', and 'order date'.
- The date reference provided in the context is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'.

Step 3: Convert the query components into structured output
- The 'cities' component in the query matches the 'City' entity in the context, so it is added to the 'DIMENSION' category in the structured output.
- The 'region' component in the query matches the 'Region' entity in the context, so it is also added to the 'DIMENSION' category in the structured output.
- The 'March 2022' component in the query is a date reference, which is outside the date range provided in the context. However, since the query specifically asks for this time period, it is added to the 'DATE VARIABLE' category in the structured output, with the 'Order Date' entity and the 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' as 'March 2022'.

Rationale: The structured output is created by identifying the relevant components in the query, matching them to the context, and organizing them into the appropriate categories.

- DATE VARIABLE: Use the converted date/time component from Step 3.

Rationale:
The query asks for the trend of growth contribution to overall discount percentage for countries in the last 10 months. To answer this, we need to identify the relevant entities from the context and map them to the components in the query. The growth contribution is mapped to 'contribution_to_growth', the overall discount percentage is mapped to 'Discount percentage', and countries are mapped to the 'Country' entity. The date/time component is converted using the 'Order Date' entity from the context.

- The query mentions ""List of cities,"" which corresponds to the ""City"" entity in the context.
- The query also mentions ""contribution of discount,"" which corresponds to the ""ratio"" entity in the context, with ""Discount"" as the applied measure.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The ""City"" entity in the query matches the ""City"" entity in the context, with ""cities"" as its other name.
- The ""contribution of discount"" in the query matches the ""ratio"" entity in the context, with ""contribution"" as its other name. The applied measure ""Discount"" is also present in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}. Since the query does not mention any specific date or time-related information, we can assume that the analysis should be done within this date range.

- In the query ""What are the customer id with profits is more than 10k"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Dimension: customer id
  - Comparison value: 10k
  - Comparison operator: more than (>)
  
Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: In the context, we find that 'profits' is an other name for the entity 'Profit'.
- Dimension: In the context, we find that 'customer id' is an other name for the entity 'Customer ID'.
- Comparison value and operator: These are not present in the context, but we can use them directly in the structured output.

Step 3: Incorporate date/time component
- The date reference is given as {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- In the context, we find that 'Order Date' is the date variable with other names like 'trend', 'yoy', 'mom', 'date', 'order date', 'when', 'time'.
- Since the query does not mention any specific date or time-related information, we can assume that the query is asking for the customer ids with profits more than 10k within the given date range.

Finally, we create the structured output using the matched components and the converted date/time component.","{'DERIVED MEASURE': {'contribution': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount percentage': 'Discount percentage'}], 'DERIVED MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': ''}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'over 2': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 years'}]}}"
City-wise discount for 2 months?,What is the discount by cities across 2 months,what,"{'MEASURE': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount', 'other names': ['discounts', 'discount']}], 'DIMENSION': [{'ENTITY': 'City', 'other names': ['cities']}], 'FILTER': [], 'DERIVED MEASURE': [], 'DATE VARIABLE': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'other names': ['trend', 'yoy', 'mom', 'date', 'order date', 'when', 'time']}]}","{'MEASURE': {'discount': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'2 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 months'}]}}","Step 1: Identify the components in the query
- In the query ""What is the discount by cities across 2 months"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: Discount
  - Dimension: Cities
  - Date Variable: 2 months

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Match the identified components to the given context:
  - Measure: Discount -> {'ENTITY': 'Discount'}
  - Dimension: Cities -> {'ENTITY': 'City'}
  - Date Variable: 2 months -> {'ENTITY': 'Order Date'}

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date variable ""2 months"" needs to be converted to a specific time range based on the date reference provided:
  - Start date: 03/01/2018
  - End date: 31/12/2021
- Since the query asks for ""across 2 months"", we need to find the last 2 months from the end date (31/12/2021). This would give us a time range of 01/11/2021 to 31/12/2021.
- Update the date variable component with the converted time element: {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 months'}

Step 4: Combine the matched components into a structured output
- Combine the matched and converted components into a structured output format:
  - MEASURE: {'discount': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount'}]}
  - DIMENSION: {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City'}]}
  - DATE VARIABLE: {'2 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 months'}]}","{'MEASURE': {'discount': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'2 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 months'}]}}"

- The query mentions ""sale"", which can be matched to the ""Sales"" entity in the context under MEASURE.
- The query mentions ""ship mode"", which can be matched to the ""Ship Mode"" entity in the context under DIMENSION.
- The query mentions ""except democratic republic of the congo"", which is a FILTER condition.
- The query mentions ""across 3 months"", which is a DATE VARIABLE condition.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""sale"" is matched to the ""Sales"" entity in the context under MEASURE.
- ""ship mode"" is matched to the ""Ship Mode"" entity in the context under DIMENSION.

Step 3: Handle the FILTER condition
- The query does not explicitly mention any filter condition in the context, so we leave the FILTER field empty in the structured output.

Step 4: Handle the DATE VARIABLE condition
- The query mentions ""across 3 months"", which implies a time range for the analysis. However, the context provides a specific date range from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'. Since the context date range is more specific, we use this date range for the analysis and do not include the ""across 3 months"" condition in the structured output.

Step 5: Create the structured output
- Based on the identified components and their matches in the context, the structured output is created with the MEASURE and DIMENSION fields populated with the corresponding entities from the context. The FILTER field is left empty, and the DATE VARIABLE condition is not included as the context provides a specific date range.","{'MEASURE': {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'ship mode': [{'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'3-month': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 3 months'}]}}"

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Growth rate: Derived measure is present in the context
- Discount percentage: Measure is present in the context
- Haiti and Central Asia: Filter is not present in the context, so we cannot apply it in the structured output
- 2.5 months: Date/Time component needs to be converted

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query mentions ""across the 2.5 months"", which implies the last 2.5 months from the end date in the date reference (31/12/2021). So, we need to calculate the time period for the last 2.5 months.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Add the derived measure ""Growth Rate"" and apply the measure ""Discount percentage"" to it.
- Add the date variable ""Order Date"" and convert the time element to ""last 2.5 months"".

Rationale: The query asks for the trend of growth rate of discount percentage for Haiti and Central Asia across the last 2.5 months. Since Haiti and Central Asia are not present in the context, we cannot apply them as filters in the structured output. However, we can still calculate the growth rate of discount percentage and consider the time period of the last 2.5 months based on the date reference provided.","{'DERIVED MEASURE': {'growth rate': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount %': 'Discount percentage'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'trend'}]}}"

- The context provides information about the 'Discount percentage' as a measure and 'Order Date' as a date variable, which are relevant to the query.
- By matching these components to the context and combining them, we can create a structured output that represents the query.","{'MEASURE': {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount percentage': 'Discount percentage'}], 'ADJECTIVE': ['lowest'], 'TONE': 'negative'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'when': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date'}]}}"

- The query asks to list cities based on monthly trends of discount.
- The components in the query are: cities, monthly trends, and discount.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- In the context, we have the following entities:
  - MEASURE: Discount (other names: discounts, discount)
  - DIMENSION: City (other names: cities)
  - DATE VARIABLE: Order Date (other names: trend)
- We can match the components from the query to the context as follows:
  - cities -> DIMENSION: City
  - discount -> MEASURE: Discount
  - monthly trends -> DATE VARIABLE: Order Date

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query asks for monthly trends, which means we need to convert the date variable (Order Date) into a monthly format.
- In the structured output, we represent this conversion as ""CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT: across months"" for the Order Date entity.

Rationale:
- The structured output is created by identifying the components in the query, matching them to the context, and converting the date/time component as needed.
- This allows us to accurately represent the query in a structured format, making it easier to process and analyze the data.","{'MEASURE': {'discount patterns': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount', 'RANK': [{'RANK ADJECTIVE': 'top', 'RANK VALUE': '1'}]}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'monthly trends': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across months'}]}}"

- The derived measure ""growth rate"" is found in the context under 'DERIVED MEASURE'.
- The measure ""discount percentage"" is found in the context under 'MEASURE'.
- The date variable ""Order Date"" is found in the context under 'DATE VARIABLE'.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The time component ""last 10 months"" is converted to a 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' and associated with the 'Order Date' entity.

Step 4: Structure the output
- The derived measure ""growth rate"" is structured with the applied measure ""discount percentage"" under 'APPLIED MEASURE'.
- The date variable ""Order Date"" is structured with the 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' ""last 10 months"".

Rationale:
- The query asks for the growth rate of discount percentage, so we need to find the derived measure ""growth rate"" and associate it with the measure ""discount percentage"".
- The time component ""last 10 months"" needs to be converted and associated with the date variable ""Order Date"" to specify the time range for the analysis.","{'DERIVED MEASURE': {'growth rate': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount percentage': 'Discount percentage'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'past 10 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 months'}]}}"

- The query asks for ""drivers of discount percentage."" 
- ""Drivers"" can be matched to the derived measure ""kda"" in the context.
- ""Discount percentage"" can be matched to the measure ""Discount percentage"" in the context.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The derived measure ""kda"" has other names such as ""driver"" and ""drivers,"" which matches the query's request for ""drivers.""
- The measure ""Discount percentage"" in the context matches the query's request for ""discount percentage.""

Step 3: Create the structured output
- Since the query is asking for drivers of discount percentage, we need to apply the derived measure ""kda"" to the measure ""Discount percentage.""
- The structured output should include the derived measure ""kda"" with the applied measure ""Discount percentage.""

Step 4: Consider the date/time component
- The date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'.
- However, the query does not specifically ask for any date-related information, so the date reference is not included in the structured output.","{'DERIVED MEASURE': {'causes': [{'ENTITY': 'kda', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount %': 'Discount percentage'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'variations': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across days'}]}}"

- In the given query, we can identify the following components: ""share"", ""el salvador"", ""south sudan"", ""profits"", ""across 2 months"".

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""share"" can be matched to the derived measure ""ratio"" in the context.
- ""profits"" can be matched to the measure ""Profit"" in the context.
- ""across 2 months"" can be matched to the date variable ""Order Date"" in the context.

Step 3: Create the structured output
- For the derived measure ""share"", we need to apply the measure ""profits"" to it. So, we add the ""APPLIED MEASURE"" key with the value [{'profits': 'Profit'}] to the derived measure.
- For the date variable ""trend"", we need to convert the time component ""across 2 months"" to a proper format. So, we add the ""CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT"" key with the value 'across 2 months' to the date variable.

Step 4: Provide rationale for the date/time component conversion
- The date/time component ""across 2 months"" is used to specify the time interval for the trend analysis. In the structured output, we have added this component to the ""CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT"" key of the date variable ""trend"" to indicate that the trend analysis should be done across 2-month intervals within the given date reference (start_date: '03/01/2018', end_date: '31/12/2021').","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'share': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 months'}]}}"

- The date/time component ""last 10 months"" is converted to a time element relative to the current date, which is represented as ""last 10 months"" in the structured output.

Rationale:
- The query asks for profits by customer id, so we need to include the measure ""profits"" and the dimension ""customer id"" in the structured output.
- The query compares the profits in two different time periods: last 10 days and last 10 months. Therefore, we need to include both date/time components in the structured output, each associated with the ""Order Date"" entity.
- The date/time components are relative to the current date, so we represent them as ""last 10 days"" and ""last 10 months"" in the structured output.

- In the query ""What is the profits by product name across 2 months"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Dimension: product name
  - Date/Time component: across 2 months

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: ""profits"" can be matched to the context's ""Profit"" entity with other names ['profit', 'profits'].
- Dimension: ""product name"" can be matched to the context's ""Product Name"" entity with other names ['product name'].
- Date/Time component: ""across 2 months"" can be matched to the context's ""Order Date"" entity with other names ['trend', 'yoy', 'mom', 'date', 'order date', 'when', 'time'].

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date/time component ""across 2 months"" needs to be converted to a more structured format. Since the reference date range is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021', we can interpret ""across 2 months"" as the ""last 2 months"" from the end date '31/12/2021'. 

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date/time component, we can create the structured output with the following elements:
  - MEASURE: {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}
  - DIMENSION: {'product name': [{'ENTITY': 'Product Name'}]}
  - DATE VARIABLE: {'across 2 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 months'}]}

The rationale behind this conversion is to identify the relevant components in the query, match them to the context, convert the date/time component to a more structured format, and create a structured output that can be used for further analysis or processing.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'product name': [{'ENTITY': 'Product Name'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'2 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 months'}]}}"

- In the query ""Why profits of envelopes changed in last 10 days"", we can identify the following components:
  - Profits (MEASURE)
  - Envelopes (FILTER)
  - Changed (DERIVED MEASURE)
  - Last 10 days (DATE VARIABLE)

Step 2: Match components to the context
- Match each component in the query to the corresponding entity in the context:
  - Profits: Matched to 'Profit' in MEASURE
  - Envelopes: Matched to 'Envelopes' in FILTER with parent 'Sub-Category'
  - Changed: Matched to 'Growth Rate' in DERIVED MEASURE
  - Last 10 days: Matched to 'Order Date' in DATE VARIABLE

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- The query mentions ""last 10 days"", which needs to be converted to a specific date range.
- To do this, we can calculate the date range by subtracting 10 days from the end_date ('31/12/2021') and use this new date as the start_date for the ""last 10 days"" period.
- The converted time element for 'last 10 days' is added to the 'Order Date' entity in DATE VARIABLE.

Step 4: Create structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date/time component, the structured output is created with the following structure:
  - MEASURE: {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}
  - FILTER: {'envelopes': [{'ENTITY': 'Envelopes', 'PARENT': 'Sub-Category'}]}
  - DERIVED MEASURE: {'why': [{'ENTITY': 'why'}], 'changed': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate'}]}

- The query mentions ""Forecast of monthly sale,"" which indicates a measure related to sales and a time element (monthly).

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- In the context, we have a measure ""Sales"" with other names ['sale', 'sales']. Since the query mentions ""sale,"" we can match it to the ""Sales"" entity in the context.
- The context also has a date variable ""Order Date"" with other names ['date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', 'order date']. Since the query mentions ""monthly,"" we can match it to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query mentions ""monthly sale,"" which indicates that we need to aggregate the sales data on a monthly basis. To do this, we need to convert the ""Order Date"" entity in the context to a monthly time element. This is done by adding the 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across months' to the ""Order Date"" entity.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date/time component, we can create the structured output with the 'MEASURE' and 'DATE VARIABLE' keys. The 'MEASURE' key will have the 'monthly sale' as its value, which is derived from the 'Sales' entity in the context. The 'DATE VARIABLE' key will have the 'monthly' as its value, which is derived from the 'Order Date' entity with the added 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across months'.","{'MEASURE': {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'month': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 days'}]}}"

- In the query ""List of sub category having discount percentage > 50k"", we can identify the following components:
  - Sub-Category (Dimension)
  - Discount percentage (Measure)
  - 50k (Comparison value)
  - '>' (Comparison operator)

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- From the given context, we can match the identified components as follows:
  - Sub-Category: {'ENTITY': 'Sub-Category', 'other names': ['sub category'], 'dataset_id': '6538e14185a957419006d762'}
  - Discount percentage: {'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage', 'other names': ['discount percentage'], 'dataset_id': '6538e14185a957419006d762'}

Step 3: Convert the query components into structured output
- Based on the matched components, we can create the structured output as follows:
  - MEASURE: {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '50k', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}]}
  - DIMENSION: {'sub category': [{'ENTITY': 'Sub-Category'}]}

Step 4: Incorporate date/time component
- The given date reference is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- Since the query does not specifically mention any date or time-related constraints, we can assume that the query is asking for the list of sub-categories having a discount percentage greater than 50k within the given date range.
- The date/time component is already provided in the context, so there is no need to modify the structured output for this step.

Rationale:
- The query is asking for a list of sub-categories with a specific condition on the discount percentage measure.
- We identified the relevant components in the query and matched them to the context provided.
- We then converted these components into a structured output format, which can be used to retrieve the desired information from the dataset.
- The date/time component is already provided in the context, so we did not need to modify the structured output for this aspect.","{'MEASURE': {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '50k', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'sub category': [{'ENTITY': 'Sub-Category'}]}}"

- In the query ""What is the profits in last 10 days"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Date variable: last 10 days

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: The context provides a measure called ""Profit"" with other names including ""profits"". So, we can match the measure ""profits"" in the query to the ""Profit"" entity in the context.
- Date variable: The context provides a date variable called ""Order Date"" with other names including ""trend"", ""yoy"", ""mom"", ""date"", ""order date"", ""when"", ""time"". Although the query's date variable ""last 10 days"" is not directly mentioned in the context, we can infer that it is related to the ""Order Date"" entity.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date variable in the query is ""last 10 days"". We need to convert this into a structured output format. Since the context provides a date reference with start and end dates, we can use this information to calculate the last 10 days from the end date.
- The end date in the date reference is '31/12/2021'. So, the last 10 days would be the time period between '22/12/2021' and '31/12/2021'.
- We can now represent this date variable as a converted time element in the structured output format: {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 days'}

Step 4: Combine the matched components and converted date variable into the structured output
- Finally, we can combine the matched measure and the converted date variable into the structured output format:

- In the query ""Why contribution of discount of Burundi changed in March 2022"", we can identify the following components:
  - Derived Measure: ""contribution of discount"" (matches with 'ratio' in the context)
  - Derived Measure: ""changed"" (matches with 'Growth Rate' in the context)
  - Derived Measure: ""why"" (matches with 'why' in the context)
  - Date Variable: ""March 2022""

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Match ""contribution of discount"" to the 'ratio' entity in the context, and apply the 'Discount' measure to it.
- Match ""changed"" to the 'Growth Rate' entity in the context, and apply the 'Discount' measure to it.
- Match ""why"" to the 'why' entity in the context, and apply the 'Discount' measure to it.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- Convert ""March 2022"" to the 'Order Date' entity in the context, with the converted time element as 'March 2022'.

Rationale:
- The query is asking for the reason behind the change in the contribution of discount in Burundi in March 2022. To answer this, we need to analyze the growth rate of the discount and its contribution to the overall growth.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- Previous quarter: Since the query asks for the change in the previous quarter, we need to convert the date variable 'Order Date' to represent the last quarter. This is done by adding the 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last quarter' to the 'Order Date' entity.

Step 4: Structure the output
- For the derived measure 'diagnose', we apply the measure 'discount percentage' to the entity 'why'.
- For the derived measure 'change', we apply the measure 'discount percentage' to the entity 'Growth Rate'.
- Finally, we include the converted date variable 'previous quarter' in the output.

Rationale:
The query asks to diagnose (find the reason for) the change in discount percentage in the previous quarter. To achieve this, we need to apply the measure 'discount percentage' to both the derived measures 'diagnose' and 'change'.

- In the query ""What is the trend of contribution of kenya sale in 15d"", we can identify the following components:
  - Trend: This indicates a time-based analysis.
  - Contribution: This is a derived measure.
  - Kenya sale: This refers to the measure 'Sales' with a specific filter for Kenya.
  - 15d: This is a date/time component.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Trend: In the context, we can see that 'Order Date' has an alias 'trend', which matches the time-based analysis requirement.
- Contribution: In the context, we can see that 'ratio' has an alias 'contribution', which matches the derived measure requirement.
- Kenya sale: In the context, we can see that 'Sales' has an alias 'sale', which matches the measure requirement. However, we need to apply a filter for Kenya.
- 15d: This is a date/time component that needs to be converted.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- In the date reference, we have a start date of '03/01/2018' and an end date of '31/12/2021'. The query asks for the trend in the last 15 days. Therefore, we need to convert '15d' into a time element that represents the last 15 days within the given date range.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the identified components and their matches in the context, we can create the structured output as follows:
  - DERIVED MEASURE: 'contribution' is represented by the 'ratio' entity, which is applied to the 'Sales' measure.
  - DATE VARIABLE: '15d' is represented by the 'Order Date' entity, with a converted time element of 'last 15 days'.

Rationale: The structured output is created by identifying the components in the query, matching them to the context, converting the date/time component, and organizing the information according to the context structure. This allows for a clear and organized representation of the query, making it easier to process and analyze.","{'MEASURE': {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 15 days'}]}}"

- ""15d"" can also be matched to the entity ""Order Date"" in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time components
- ""monthly trend"" is converted to ""across months"" as it refers to a monthly pattern.
- ""15d"" is converted to ""last 15 days"" as it refers to a specific time frame of 15 days.

Rationale:
The query asks for the monthly trend of sales and discounts for Kenya and South Korea within the last 15 days. The structured output captures this information by identifying the relevant measures (Sales and Discount), the dimension (Country), and the date variables (Order Date with ""across months"" and ""last 15 days""). This allows for a clear representation of the query's components and their relationships, making it easier to process and analyze the data.","{'MEASURE': {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}], 'discounts': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'country': [{'ENTITY': 'Country'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date'}]}}"

- In the query ""List of cities"", the main component is ""cities"".

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- In the context, we can find a match for ""cities"" under the 'DIMENSION' key, where 'City' is mentioned as an entity with 'cities' as one of its other names.

Step 3: Identify the date/time component in the query
- The query does not have any explicit date/time component.

Step 4: Match the date/time component to the context
- Since there is no date/time component in the query, we don't need to match it to the context. However, we can still consider the date reference provided, which is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.

Step 5: Create the structured output
- Based on the identified components and their matches in the context, we can create the structured output. In this case, the output will have a 'DIMENSION' key with 'cities' as its value, and the corresponding entity 'City' from the context.

Rationale:
- The query is asking for a list of cities, which is a dimension in the context. Since there is no explicit date/time component in the query, we don't need to include it in the structured output. However, we can still consider the date reference provided for any further analysis or filtering if needed.",{'DIMENSION': {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City'}]}}

- In the query ""How many product name where profits is more than 10k"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Dimension: product name
  - Measure constraint: profits > 10k

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- From the context, we can match the following components:
  - Measure: 'profits' matches with 'Profit' in the context.
  - Dimension: 'product name' matches with 'Product Name' in the context.

Step 3: Convert the components into structured output
- For the measure 'profits', we can add the measure constraint 'profits > 10k' as a comparison value and operator in the structured output.
- For the dimension 'product name', we can add the entity 'Product Name' in the structured output.

Step 4: Consider the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- Since the query does not mention any specific date or time constraint, we can assume that the query is asking for the information within the given date range.
- There is no need to add any date/time component in the structured output, as it is already considered within the given date range.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '10k', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'product name': [{'ENTITY': 'Product Name'}]}}"

- In the query ""What are the key drivers of sale"", we can identify the following components:
  - ""key drivers"" refers to a derived measure
  - ""sale"" refers to a measure

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- From the context, we can match the components as follows:
  - ""key drivers"" can be matched to the derived measure 'kda' with other names ['key driver', 'drivers', 'key drivers']
  - ""sale"" can be matched to the measure 'Sales' with other names ['sale']

Step 3: Identify the date/time component
- The date reference is given as {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}

Step 4: Convert the query into a structured output
- Based on the identified components and their matches in the context, we can create the structured output as follows:
  - For the derived measure 'key drivers', we can apply the measure 'Sales' as the entity it is derived from. This can be represented as {'key drivers': [{'ENTITY': 'kda', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'sale': 'Sales'}]}]}

Step 5: Rationale
- The query asks for the key drivers of sale, which implies that we need to find the derived measure 'kda' that is based on the measure 'Sales'. By matching the components in the query to the context, we can create a structured output that represents this relationship. The date/time component is not explicitly mentioned in the query, but it is given in the date reference, which can be used to filter the data if needed.","{'DERIVED MEASURE': {'key drivers': [{'ENTITY': 'kda', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'sale': 'Sales'}]}]}}"

- In the query ""What is the profits in last 10 days"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Date variable: last 10 days

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: The context provides a measure called ""Profit"" with other names including ""profits"". So, we can match the measure ""profits"" in the query to the ""Profit"" entity in the context.
- Date variable: The context provides a date variable called ""Order Date"" with other names including ""trend"", ""yoy"", ""mom"", ""date"", ""order date"", ""when"", ""time"". Although the query's date variable ""last 10 days"" is not directly mentioned in the context, we can infer that it is related to the ""Order Date"" entity.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date variable in the query is ""last 10 days"". We need to convert this into a structured output format. Since the context provides a date reference with start and end dates, we can use this information to calculate the last 10 days from the end date.
- The end date in the date reference is '31/12/2021'. So, the last 10 days would be the time period between '22/12/2021' and '31/12/2021'.
- We can now represent this date variable as a converted time element in the structured output format: {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 days'}

Step 4: Combine the matched components and converted date variable into the structured output
- Finally, we can combine the matched measure and the converted date variable into the structured output format:

- The query asks for the ""discount"" which is a measure.
- The query mentions ""across 2 months"" which is a date/time component.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The measure ""discount"" can be matched to the entity ""Discount"" in the context.
- The date/time component ""across 2 months"" needs to be converted to a proper date range based on the date reference provided.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'.
- The query asks for the discount ""across 2 months"", which means we need to consider the last 2 months from the end date of the date reference.
- The end date is '31/12/2021', so the last 2 months would be from '01/11/2021' to '31/12/2021'.
- This converted time element is added to the structured output as 'last 2 months'.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The measure ""discount"" is added to the structured output as {'discount': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount'}]}.
- The date variable with the converted time element is added to the structured output as {'2 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 months'}]}.

Step 2: Match components to the context
- Match ""why"" to the derived measure ""why"" in the context.
- Match ""share of profits"" to the derived measure ""ratio"" in the context, with the applied measure ""profits"".
- Match ""changed"" to the derived measure ""Growth Rate"" in the context, with the applied measure ""profits"".
- Match ""1st quarter of last year"" to the date variable ""Order Date"" in the context, with the converted time element ""quarter 1 last year"".

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- Convert ""1st quarter of last year"" to the time element ""quarter 1 last year"" by understanding that ""1st quarter"" refers to the first quarter of a year and ""last year"" refers to the previous year.

Rationale:
- The query is asking for the reason behind the change in the share of profits for El Salvador in the first quarter of the previous year. 
- To answer this question, we need to analyze the growth rate of profits (derived measure ""changed"") and the share of profits (derived measure ""ratio"") during that specific time period (date variable ""1st quarter of last year"").

- 15d: Date variable is matched to {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'other names': ['date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', 'order date']}

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- 15d is a shorthand for ""last 15 days"". We can convert this to a more structured format by using the date reference provided. Since the end_date is '31/12/2021', we can calculate the start date for the last 15 days as '17/12/2021'. So, the date range for the 15d component is {'start_date': '17/12/2021', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- For the derived measure 'diagnose', we need to apply the measure 'Sales' to the entity 'why'.
- For the derived measure 'contribution', we need to apply the entity 'ratio'.
- For the date variable, we need to apply the converted time element 'last 15 days' to the entity 'Order Date'.

Rationale:
- The query asks to diagnose the contribution of sales in Kenya for the last 15 days. This means we need to analyze the 'why' and 'ratio' derived measures for the 'Sales' measure.

- List sub category: Dimension
- Contribution to growth: Derived Measure
- Discount percentage: Measure
- Previous quarter: Date Variable

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Sub category: Matches with 'Sub-Category' in the context
- Contribution to growth: Matches with 'contribution_to_growth' in the context
- Discount percentage: Matches with 'Discount percentage' in the context
- Previous quarter: Matches with 'Order Date' in the context, but needs to be converted to the specific time element

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- Previous quarter: Convert 'Order Date' to 'last quarter' based on the date reference provided

Rationale:
The query asks for a list of sub-categories based on their contribution to the growth of discount percentage in the previous quarter. To achieve this, we need to identify the relevant dimensions, measures, and date variables from the context and convert them into a structured output.

We first identify the components in the query and match them to the context. The dimension 'sub category' matches with 'Sub-Category' in the context. The derived measure 'contribution to growth' matches with 'contribution_to_growth' in the context, and it is applied to the measure 'discount percentage', which matches with 'Discount percentage' in the context.

The date variable 'previous quarter' needs to be converted to a specific time element based on the date reference provided. In this case, we convert 'Order Date' to 'last quarter' to represent the previous quarter. This allows us to filter the data based on the desired time frame and obtain the required information.","{'DIMENSION': {'subcategory': [{'ENTITY': 'Sub-Category'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'discount percentage growth': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount percentage': 'Discount percentage'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'previous 3 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 3 months'}]}}"

- The query asks for the first time when two conditions are met: discount percentage and sales of Haiti are both greater than 20,000.
- The components in the query are: discount percentage, sales, first time, and the comparison value of 20,000.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Discount percentage: matches the ENTITY 'Discount percentage' in the context.
- Sales: matches the ENTITY 'Sales' in the context.
- First time: can be considered as an ADJECTIVE in the structured output.
- Comparison value of 20,000: will be used as a COMPARISON VALUE in the structured output.

Step 3: Create the MEASURE constraints
- For both discount percentage and sales, we need to create MEASURE CONSTRAINTS with a COMPARISON OPERATOR of '>' and a COMPARISON VALUE of '20000'.

Step 4: Add the ADJECTIVE 'first time' to the MEASURE
- Since the query asks for the first time when the conditions are met, we need to add the ADJECTIVE 'first time' to both discount percentage and sales in the structured output.

Step 5: Identify the date/time component
- The query asks for the first time when the conditions are met, which is a date/time component.
- In the context, the ENTITY 'Order Date' has the other name 'time', which matches the date/time component in the query.

Step 6: Add the DATE VARIABLE to the structured output
- Since the query asks for the first time when the conditions are met, we need to include the ENTITY 'Order Date' as a DATE VARIABLE in the structured output with the other name 'when'.","{'MEASURE': {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '20000', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}], 'sales': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '20000', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'when': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'first time'}]}}"

- In the query ""What is the growth rate of profits for the 1st quarter of last year"", we can identify the following components:
  - Derived Measure: Growth Rate
  - Measure: Profits
  - Date Variable: 1st quarter of last year

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Growth Rate: In the context, we can find ""Growth Rate"" under 'DERIVED MEASURE' with other names such as 'growth rate' and 'growth'.
- Profits: In the context, we can find ""Profit"" under 'MEASURE' with other names such as 'profits'.
- 1st quarter of last year: In the context, we can find ""Order Date"" under 'DATE VARIABLE' with other names such as 'date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', and 'order date'.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date variable ""1st quarter of last year"" needs to be converted into a structured format. In the context, we can see that 'Order Date' is the relevant date variable. We can convert ""1st quarter of last year"" into a structured format as 'quarter 1 last year'.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date variable, we can create the structured output as follows:
  - DERIVED MEASURE: {'growth rate': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}
  - DATE VARIABLE: {'1st quarter of last year': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'quarter 1 last year'}]}

- Filter: ""envelopes"" can be matched to the ""Envelopes"" entity with parent ""Sub-Category"" in the context. ""thailand"" can be matched to the ""Southeast Asia"" entity with parent ""Region"" in the context.
- Date variable: ""last 10 days"" can be matched to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- The date variable ""last 10 days"" needs to be converted to a specific date range. Since the end date in the date reference is ""31/12/2021"", we can calculate the start date for the last 10 days as ""22/12/2021"". Therefore, the converted time element for ""last 10 days"" is the date range ""22/12/2021"" to ""31/12/2021"".

- The query specifies a condition ""> 50k"" which is a filter on the discount percentage.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The ""sub category"" in the query matches the ""Sub-Category"" entity in the context under 'DIMENSION'.
- The ""discount percentage"" in the query matches the ""Discount percentage"" entity in the context under 'MEASURE'.

Step 3: Create the structured output
- Since the query asks for sub categories, we include the ""Sub-Category"" entity in the 'DIMENSION' part of the structured output.
- The query does not mention any date or time component, so we do not need to include any 'DATE VARIABLE' in the structured output.

Rationale:
- The query asks for sub categories with a specific condition on the discount percentage, so we include the ""Sub-Category"" entity in the 'DIMENSION' part of the structured output.
- The query does not mention any date or time component, so we do not need to include any 'DATE VARIABLE' in the structured output.

- ""Previous quarter"" can also be matched to the 'DATE VARIABLE' entity in the context: {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'other names': ['trend']}.

Step 3: Convert the date/time components
- ""Yearly trend"" refers to a time element that needs to be analyzed across years. Therefore, it is converted to 'across years' in the structured output: {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across years'}.
- ""Previous quarter"" refers to a time element that needs to be analyzed for the last quarter. Therefore, it is converted to 'last quarter' in the structured output: {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last quarter'}.

Step 4: Combine the matched components and converted date/time elements into the structured output
- The 'MEASURE' component is represented as {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage'}]}.
- The 'DATE VARIABLE' component is represented as {'yearly trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across years'}], 'previous quarter': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last quarter'}]}.

- Contribution: Found in the DERIVED MEASURE section as ""contribution"" or ""ratio""
- Discount percentage: Found in the MEASURE section as ""Discount percentage""
- Timeframe: Found in the DATE VARIABLE section as ""Order Date""

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- ""last 10 months"" is a relative time period, so we need to convert it to a specific date range based on the date reference provided.
- Date reference: start_date = '03/01/2018', end_date = '31/12/2021'
- To calculate the last 10 months, we count back 10 months from the end_date (31/12/2021) and use that as the new start_date for the query.

Step 4: Structure the output
- DERIVED MEASURE: We use ""contribution"" as the main entity and apply the ""Discount percentage"" measure to it. There are no constraints in this case.
- DATE VARIABLE: We use the converted time element ""last 10 months"" and associate it with the ""Order Date"" entity.

Rationale:
The query asks for the contribution of Haiti to the overall discount percentage in the last 10 months. We need to calculate the ratio or contribution of Haiti's discount percentage to the overall discount percentage during this time period. To do this, we use the derived measure ""contribution"" and apply the ""Discount percentage"" measure to it.

- ""top countries"" matches with ""Country"" in the context
- ""by discount percentage"" matches with ""Discount percentage"" in the context
- ""across city"" matches with ""City"" in the context

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- ""2.5 months"" needs to be converted into days for better understanding
- 2.5 months = 2.5 * 30 = 75 days (assuming 30 days per month)
- The date range will be the last 75 days from the end_date in the date reference

- MEASURE: Include ""Discount percentage""
- DATE VARIABLE: Include ""Order Date"" with the converted time element (last 75 days)

Rationale:
- The query asks for the top countries based on discount percentage, so we need to include the ""Country"" dimension with a rank (top 1).
- The query also mentions ""across city,"" which means we need to include the ""City"" dimension.
- The measure we are interested in is ""discount percentage,"" so we include it in the structured output.

- The query asks for the ""monthly trend of profits"" which indicates the measure is 'profits'.
- The query specifies the time frame as ""1st quarter of last year"", which includes three date components: 'monthly trend', '1st quarter', and 'last year'.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The measure 'profits' can be matched to the context's 'Profit' entity.
- The date components 'monthly trend', '1st quarter', and 'last year' can be matched to the context's 'Order Date' entity.

Step 3: Convert the date/time components
- 'monthly trend' is converted to 'across months' as it indicates the trend across different months.
- '1st quarter' is converted to 'quarter 1' as it refers to the first quarter of the year.
- 'last year' is converted to 'last year' as it refers to the previous year from the current date.

Rationale:
The query asks for the monthly trend of profits in the 1st quarter of the last year. To answer this question, we need to consider the measure 'profits' and the date components 'monthly trend', '1st quarter', and 'last year'.

Q1 profits growth trend last year?,What is the trend of growth rate of profits in 1st quarter of last year,trend_growth_rate,"{'MEASURE': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit', 'other names': ['profits']}], 'DIMENSION': [], 'FILTER': [], 'DERIVED MEASURE': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'other names': ['growth rate', 'growth']}], 'DATE VARIABLE': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'other names': ['trend']}]}","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'growth rate': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'quarter 1 last year'}]}}","Step 1: Identify the components in the query
- In the given query, we can identify the following components: ""trend"", ""growth rate"", ""profits"", and ""1st quarter of last year"".

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""trend"" can be matched to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context.
- ""growth rate"" can be matched to the ""Growth Rate"" derived measure in the context.
- ""profits"" can be matched to the ""Profit"" measure in the context.

Step 3: Identify the date/time component and convert it
- The date/time component in the query is ""1st quarter of last year"".
- To convert this component, we need to find the corresponding time period in the given date reference. The date reference has a start date of ""03/01/2018"" and an end date of ""31/12/2021"".
- Since the query asks for the 1st quarter of last year, we need to find the 1st quarter of 2020 (as 2021 is the last year in the date reference). The 1st quarter of 2020 corresponds to the time period between ""01/01/2020"" and ""31/03/2020"".
- Therefore, the converted time element for ""1st quarter of last year"" is ""quarter 1 last year"".

Step 4: Construct the structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date/time component, we can construct the structured output as follows:
  - MEASURE: {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}
  - DERIVED MEASURE: {'growth rate': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}
  - DATE VARIABLE: {'trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'quarter 1 last year'}]}

Rationale:
- The query asks for the trend of the growth rate of profits in the 1st quarter of last year. To answer this question, we need to calculate the growth rate of profits for the specified time period (1st quarter of last year) and analyze the trend based on the order date.
- The structured output captures all the necessary components from the context and the query, including the measure (profits), the derived measure (growth rate), and the date variable (trend) with the converted time element (quarter 1 last year). This structured output can be used to perform the required analysis and answer the query.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'growth trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last year'}]}}"

- In the query, we can identify the following components: profits, sales, product name, ship mode, and 1st quarter of last year.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Profits: Matched to the 'Profit' entity in the context.
- Sales: Matched to the 'Sales' entity in the context.
- Product Name: Matched to the 'Product Name' entity in the context.
- Ship Mode: Matched to the 'Ship Mode' entity in the context.
- 1st quarter of last year: Matched to the 'Order Date' entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date/time component in the query is ""1st quarter of last year"". To convert this, we need to understand the reference dates provided in the context: start_date is '03/01/2018' and end_date is '31/12/2021'.
- Since the end_date is '31/12/2021', the last year would be 2020. The 1st quarter of 2020 would be from '01/01/2020' to '31/03/2020'.
- The converted time element for the 'Order Date' entity would be 'quarter 1 last year'.

Rationale: The query asks for profits and sales by product name and ship mode in the 1st quarter of last year. We identified the components in the query and matched them to the context. Then, we converted the date/time component based on the reference dates provided in the context. This allowed us to create a structured output that accurately represents the query.","{'MEASURE': {'sales': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}], 'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'product name': [{'ENTITY': 'Product Name'}], 'ship mode': [{'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'1st quarter last yr': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'quarter 1 last year'}]}}"

- In the query ""Forecast of yearly profits in last 10 days"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Date variable: yearly, last 10 days

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: ""profits"" can be matched to the context as ""Profit"" (mentioned in the 'other names' list)
- Date variable: ""yearly"" and ""last 10 days"" are not directly mentioned in the context, but ""Order Date"" is mentioned as a date variable with other names like 'date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', 'order date'. We can use this information to convert the date variables.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- For ""yearly"", we can convert it to ""across years"" as it refers to the yearly aggregation of profits.
- For ""last 10 days"", we can keep it as ""last 10 days"" since it refers to the specific time period we are interested in.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the above steps, we can create the structured output with the identified and converted components:
  - Measure: {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}
  - Date variable: {'yearly': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across years'}], 'last 10 days': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 days'}]}

- Order Date: {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'other names': ['time', 'when']}

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- Last 10 days: Since the query asks for the first time that profits and discounts were more than 10k in the last 10 days, we need to convert this into a date variable. We can use the 'Order Date' entity from the context and apply the 'last 10 days' constraint to it.

Rationale:
The query is asking for the first time that profits and discounts of envelopes were more than 10k in the last 10 days. To answer this, we need to consider the measures (profits and discounts), the filter (envelopes), and the date variable (last 10 days). We match these components to the context and convert the date/time component accordingly. This allows us to create a structured output that captures all the necessary information to answer the query.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '10000', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}], 'discounts': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '10000', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'when': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 days'}]}}"

- Measure: ""profits""
- Comparison value: ""10k"" (10000)
- Comparison operator: ""more than"" (>)
- Adjective: ""first""
- Date variable: ""1st quarter of last year""

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: ""profits"" matches with ""Profit"" in the context
- Date variable: ""1st quarter of last year"" matches with ""Order Date"" in the context

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- ""1st quarter of last year"" is a relative time reference, which needs to be converted to an absolute time range. Given the date reference with start_date as '03/01/2018' and end_date as '31/12/2021', the last year would be 2020. Therefore, the 1st quarter of last year would be from '01/01/2020' to '31/03/2020'.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- For the measure ""profits"", add the entity ""Profit"" and the measure constraint with comparison value ""10000"" and comparison operator "">"".
- Add the adjective ""first"" to the measure.
- For the date variable ""when"", add the entity ""Order Date"" and the converted time element ""1st quarter of last year"".

Rationale:
The query asks for the first time when the profits of El Salvador were more than 10k in the 1st quarter of last year. To answer this, we need to identify the measure (profits), the comparison value (10k), the comparison operator (more than), and the date variable (1st quarter of last year).

- The date/time component ""monthly trend"" refers to the trend across months. In the context, we have the date variable ""Order Date"" which can be used to represent this trend. So, we convert ""monthly trend"" to ""across months"" for the ""Order Date"" entity.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date/time component, we can create the structured output as follows:
  - DIMENSION: {'ship mode': [{'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode'}]}
  - DERIVED MEASURE: {'contribution': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'sale': 'Sales'}]}]}
  - DATE VARIABLE: {'monthly trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across months'}]}

Rationale:
- The query asks for the monthly trend of the contribution of ship mode sale. To answer this, we need to consider the dimension ""Ship Mode"", the derived measure ""ratio"" applied to the measure ""Sales"", and the date variable ""Order Date"" with a converted time element of ""across months"". The structured output captures all these components and their relationships, allowing us to analyze the data as requested.","{'MEASURE': {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'ship mode': [{'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'contribution': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'sale': 'Sales'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'monthly'}]}}"

- In the query ""What is the profits of el salvador in 1st quarter of last year"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Date variable: 1st quarter of last year
  - Filter: el salvador

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: ""profits"" can be matched to the ""Profit"" entity in the context, as it is listed as an alternative name.
- Date variable: ""1st quarter of last year"" can be matched to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context, as it is a date-related term.
- Filter: ""el salvador"" is not explicitly mentioned in the context, but it can be inferred as a filter for the data.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date variable ""1st quarter of last year"" needs to be converted into a structured format. Since the context provides a date reference with start and end dates, we can use this information to determine the specific time period for ""last year"".
- Given the end date of ""31/12/2021"", ""last year"" would refer to the year 2020.
- Therefore, ""1st quarter of last year"" can be converted into a structured format as ""quarter 1 last year"", which corresponds to the time period from 01/01/2020 to 31/03/2020.

Step 4: Combine the matched components and converted date variable into a structured output
- The structured output should include the matched measure, date variable, and filter.
- Measure: {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}
- Date variable: {'1st quarter of last year': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'quarter 1 last year'}]}

- In the query ""What is the sale by ship mode in 15d"", we can identify the following components:
  - ""sale"" refers to the measure
  - ""ship mode"" refers to the dimension
  - ""15d"" refers to the date/time component

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- From the given context, we can match the identified components as follows:
  - ""sale"" matches with the entity ""Sales"" and its other names
  - ""ship mode"" matches with the entity ""Ship Mode"" and its other names
  - ""15d"" needs to be converted to a date range based on the date reference provided

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date/time component ""15d"" refers to the last 15 days. To convert this into a date range, we need to consider the end date provided in the date reference, which is ""31/12/2021"".
- Subtracting 15 days from the end date, we get the start date for the range as ""16/12/2021"".
- So, the converted date range for ""15d"" is from ""16/12/2021"" to ""31/12/2021"".

In the given query ""What are the key drivers of profits"", we can identify the following components:
- Key drivers (a derived measure)
- Profits (a measure)

Step 2: Match components to the context
Now, we match these components to the given context:
- Key drivers can be matched to the derived measure 'kda' with other names like 'key driver', 'drivers', 'key drivers'.
- Profits can be matched to the measure 'Profit' with other names like 'profits'.

Step 3: Create structured output
We create the structured output by combining the matched components from the context:
- For the measure 'profits', we add the entity 'Profit' from the context.
- For the derived measure 'key drivers', we add the entity 'kda' from the context and also include the applied measure 'profits' (which is 'Profit' from the context). We also add an empty derived measure constraint since there is no comparison value or operator mentioned in the query.

Step 4: Incorporate date/time component
Since the date reference is given as {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}, we can assume that the analysis of key drivers of profits should be done within this date range. However, the query itself does not mention any specific date or time component, so we do not need to include it in the structured output.

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- ""Previous quarter"" is converted to ""last quarter"" for the Order Date entity.

Step 4: Structure the output
- Dimension: Sub-Category with a rank of bottom 1
- Derived Measure: Growth Rate applied to Discount percentage
- Date Variable: Order Date with a constraint of last quarter

Rationale:
- The query asks for the bottom sub-category based on the trend of growth rate of discount percentage in the previous quarter.
- The dimension is Sub-Category, and we need to rank it based on the growth rate of discount percentage.
- The growth rate is a derived measure that needs to be applied to the discount percentage measure.
- The time constraint is the previous quarter, which is converted to ""last quarter"" for the Order Date entity.","{'DIMENSION': {'sub category': [{'ENTITY': 'Sub-Category', 'RANK': [{'RANK ADJECTIVE': 'lowest', 'RANK VALUE': '1'}]}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'growth': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount percentage': 'Discount percentage'}], 'DERIVED MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': ''}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last quarter'}]}}"

- In the query ""What is the contribution of haiti for discount percentage"", we can identify the following components:
  - Derived Measure: ""contribution""
  - Entity: ""haiti""
  - Measure: ""discount percentage""

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- From the given context, we can match the following components:
  - Derived Measure: ""contribution"" matches with ""ratio"" in the context.
  - Measure: ""discount percentage"" matches with ""Discount percentage"" in the context.

Step 3: Identify the date/time component
- The date reference is given as {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.

- The query asks for a list of cities, which is a dimension.
- It mentions monthly trends of discount, which is a measure and a date variable.
- The time frame specified is March 2022.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The dimension 'City' can be matched to the context entity 'City' with other names ['cities'].
- The measure 'discount' can be matched to the context entity 'Discount' with other names ['discounts', 'discount'].
- The date variable 'monthly trends' can be matched to the context entity 'Order Date' with other names ['trend'].

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query specifies the time frame as March 2022. This can be converted into a date range by setting the start date as '01/03/2022' and the end date as '31/03/2022'.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The dimension 'cities' is mapped to the context entity 'City'.
- The measure 'discount' is mapped to the context entity 'Discount'.
- The date variable 'monthly trends' is mapped to the context entity 'Order Date' with the converted time element 'March 2022' (start date: '01/03/2022', end date: '31/03/2022').

Rationale:
- The query asks for a list of cities based on monthly trends of discount in March 2022. This requires identifying the dimension (cities), measure (discount), and date variable (monthly trends) in the query and matching them to the context.
- The date/time component is converted to a specific date range to make it easier to filter the data based on the specified time frame (March 2022).","{'MEASURE': {'discount trends': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'March 22': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'March 22, 2022'}]}}"

- The query asks for the time when the growth rate of discount was highest. So, we have the following components:
  - Growth Rate (Derived Measure)
  - Discount (Measure)
  - Highest (Adjective)
  - When (Date Variable)

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Growth Rate: Found in the context as a Derived Measure with other names ['growth rate', 'growth'].
- Discount: Found in the context as a Measure with other names ['discount'].
- Highest: This is an adjective that indicates a positive tone and is related to the Growth Rate.
- When: Found in the context as a Date Variable with other names ['when'].

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- The query asks for ""when"" the growth rate was highest, which corresponds to the Date Variable 'Order Date' in the context.
- Since the query does not specify a particular date range, we can assume that the analysis should be done within the given date reference.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the identified components and their matches in the context, we can create the structured output as follows:
  - For the Derived Measure 'growth rate', we include the Applied Measure 'discount', the adjective 'highest', and the tone 'positive'.
  - For the Date Variable 'when', we include the ENTITY 'Order Date'.
- The final structured output is created by combining these components.","{'DERIVED MEASURE': {'growth rate': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount': 'Discount'}], 'ADJECTIVE': ['highest'], 'TONE': 'positive'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'when': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date'}]}}"

- The query asks for the yearly trend of profits and discounts in the last 10 days. So, we have two measures: profits and discounts, and two date/time components: yearly trend and last 10 days.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- In the context, we have 'Profit' and 'Discount' as entities under 'MEASURE', which match the profits and discounts in the query. 
- For the date variable, we have 'Order Date' in the context, which can be used to calculate the yearly trend and last 10 days.

Step 3: Convert the date/time components
- For the yearly trend, we need to convert the 'Order Date' entity to represent data across years. So, we add 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across years' to the 'Order Date' entity.
- For the last 10 days, we need to convert the 'Order Date' entity to represent data for the last 10 days. So, we add 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 days' to the 'Order Date' entity.

- Kenya: Not found in the context, but it is a filter for the country
- Overall sale: Matched to 'Sales' in the context under 'MEASURE'
- 3 months: Matched to 'Order Date' in the context under 'DATE VARIABLE'

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- 3 months: Since the query asks for the contribution across 3 months, we need to convert this into a time element. In the context, 'Order Date' is the date variable, so we can use this to filter the data for the last 3 months.

Rationale:
The query asks for the contribution of Kenya to overall sales across 3 months. To answer this, we need to calculate the ratio of sales in Kenya to the total sales for the given time period. We identified the components in the query and matched them to the context. Then, we converted the date/time component to filter the data for the last 3 months using the 'Order Date' variable. This allows us to calculate the contribution of Kenya to overall sales for the specified time period.","{'DERIVED MEASURE': {'3-month sales share': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'sale': 'Sales'}]}]}}"

- The query asks for a ""list of countries and city.""
- It has a condition: ""discount percentage greater than 20000.""
- There is no specific date or time constraint mentioned in the query.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""countries"" and ""city"" can be matched to the ""Country"" and ""City"" entities in the DIMENSION context.
- ""discount percentage"" can be matched to the ""Discount percentage"" entity in the MEASURE context.

Step 3: Create the structured output
- For the MEASURE component, we need to include the ""Discount percentage"" entity and add the constraint ""greater than 20000.""
- For the DIMENSION component, we need to include both ""Country"" and ""City"" entities.

Step 4: Handle the date/time component
- Since there is no specific date or time constraint mentioned in the query, we do not need to include the ""Order Date"" entity from the DATE VARIABLE context in the structured output.
- However, the date reference provided in the context ('start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021') can be used to filter the data if needed, but it is not explicitly required by the query.

Rationale:
- The query asks for a list of countries and cities with a specific condition on the discount percentage.
- We identified the relevant entities from the context and matched them to the components in the query.
- We created the structured output by including the identified entities and the condition on the discount percentage.
- We considered the date/time component but did not include it in the structured output since it was not explicitly required by the query.","{'MEASURE': {'discount': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '20000', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'countries': [{'ENTITY': 'Country'}], 'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City'}]}}"

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Match the identified components to the context provided:
  - Profits: {'ENTITY': 'Profit', 'other names': ['profits']}
  - Discounts: {'ENTITY': 'Discount', 'other names': ['discounts'], 'dataset_id': '6538e14185a957419006d762'}
  - Customer ID: {'ENTITY': 'Customer ID', 'other names': ['customer id']}
  - 3 years: This component needs to be converted using the date reference provided.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- The query asks for data ""across 3 years"". We can calculate the years by subtracting the start_date year (2018) from the end_date year (2021), which gives us 3 years.
- The date component is then converted to {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across years'}.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date component, we can create the structured output as follows:

- In the query ""What will be sale in 15d for Kenya"", we can identify the following components:
  - ""sale"" refers to the measure we are interested in.
  - ""15d"" refers to a date variable, specifically a future time period of 15 days.
  - ""Kenya"" is not explicitly mentioned in the context, but it can be inferred as a filter or dimension related to the location.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Match ""sale"" to the context: In the context, we can see that ""sale"" is listed as an other name for the entity ""Sales"". So, we can match ""sale"" to the ""Sales"" entity.
- Match ""15d"" to the context: In the context, we have a date variable ""Order Date"" with other names like ""date"", ""when"", ""yoy"", ""trend"", ""mom"", ""time"", and ""order date"". Since ""15d"" is a date variable, we can match it to the ""Order Date"" entity.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- Convert ""15d"" to a more structured format: Since ""15d"" refers to a future time period of 15 days, we can convert it to a more structured format by associating it with the ""Order Date"" entity and specifying it as ""next 15 days"".

- The query asks for countries, which is a dimension.
- It mentions a discount percentage greater than 20000, which is a measure.
- The time frame is specified as 2.5 months, which is a date variable.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The dimension 'countries' can be matched to the 'Country' entity in the context.
- The measure 'discount percentage' can be matched to the 'Discount percentage' entity in the context.
- The date variable '2.5 months' can be matched to the 'Order Date' entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date variable '2.5 months' needs to be converted into a more specific time frame.
- Since there are approximately 30 days in a month, 2.5 months would be equal to 2.5 * 30 = 75 days.
- The time frame can be represented as 'last 75 days' relative to the end_date provided in the date reference.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The dimension 'countries' is represented as {'ENTITY': 'Country'}.

- In the query ""What is the monthly trend of contribution of ship mode sale"", we can identify the following components:
  - ""monthly trend"" refers to a date/time component
  - ""contribution"" refers to a derived measure
  - ""ship mode"" refers to a dimension
  - ""sale"" refers to a measure

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Match ""sale"" to the measure ""Sales"" in the context
- Match ""ship mode"" to the dimension ""Ship Mode"" in the context
- Match ""contribution"" to the derived measure ""ratio"" in the context

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date/time component ""monthly trend"" refers to the trend across months. In the context, we have the date variable ""Order Date"" which can be used to represent this trend. So, we convert ""monthly trend"" to ""across months"" for the ""Order Date"" entity.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date/time component, we can create the structured output as follows:

- The query asks for the ""lowest growth rate of discount percentage.""
- The time frame mentioned is ""across 2.5 months.""

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The context provides information about the 'Discount percentage' entity, which matches the 'discount percentage' in the query.
- The context also provides information about the 'Growth Rate' derived measure, which matches the 'growth rate' in the query.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query mentions ""across 2.5 months,"" which needs to be converted into days.
- 2.5 months can be approximated as 2.5 * 30 = 75 days.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The 'Growth Rate' derived measure is applied to the 'Discount percentage' entity.
- The adjective 'lowest' is added to indicate the query is looking for the lowest growth rate.
- The tone is set to 'negative' as the query is asking for the lowest value.
- The 'Order Date' entity is used as the date variable, with the converted time element of 'last 75 days.'

Rationale:
The query is asking for the lowest growth rate of discount percentage across a specific time frame (2.5 months).

- In the query ""Why share of discount percentage of guinea changed in previous quarter"", we can identify the following components:
  - ""share of discount percentage"" refers to the ratio or percentage of discount percentage.
  - ""guinea"" is not mentioned in the context, so we can ignore it.
  - ""changed"" refers to the Growth Rate.
  - ""previous quarter"" refers to a specific time period.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""share"" can be matched to the derived measure ""ratio"" with other names ""share"" and ""percentage"".
- ""discount percentage"" can be matched to the measure ""Discount percentage"" in the context.
- ""changed"" can be matched to the derived measure ""Growth Rate"" with other names ""changed"".
- ""previous quarter"" can be matched to the date variable ""Order Date"" with other names including ""time"" and ""trend"".

Step 3: Convert the date/time component

- Order Date: {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'other names': ['date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', 'order date']}

Step 3: Convert the query into structured output
- DIMENSION: Since the query asks for the top customer id, we need to rank the Customer ID dimension. We add the RANK attribute with the 'top' adjective and a rank value of '1'.
- DERIVED MEASURE: The query asks for the yearly growth rate of profits. We apply the Growth Rate entity to the Profit measure and leave the comparison value and operator empty since we are not comparing it to a specific value.
- DATE VARIABLE: The query asks for the yearly growth rate, so we need to convert the Order Date entity to 'across years' to represent the yearly time element.

Rationale:
The structured output is created by identifying the components in the query, matching them to the context, and converting them into the appropriate format. The date/time component is converted by identifying the time element in the query (yearly) and applying it to the Order Date entity. This allows the structured output to accurately represent the information requested in the query.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'customer id': [{'ENTITY': 'Customer ID', 'RANK': [{'RANK ADJECTIVE': 'top', 'RANK VALUE': '1'}]}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'growth': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'yearly': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across years'}]}}"

- Share of Kenya to overall sale: This is a derived measure (ratio) that needs to be calculated.
- Lowest: This is an adjective describing the derived measure (share).
- Across 3 months: This is a time element related to the date variable (Order Date).

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Share of Kenya to overall sale: This can be matched to the derived measure 'ratio' in the context, with the applied measure 'Sales'.
- Lowest: This can be matched to the adjective 'lowest' in the context, with a negative tone.
- Across 3 months: This can be matched to the date variable 'Order Date' in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The time element ""across 3 months"" needs to be converted and associated with the date variable 'Order Date'. This can be done by adding the 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' attribute to the 'Order Date' entity in the structured output.

Rationale:
The query asks for the time when the share of Kenya to overall sales was the lowest across a 3-month period. To answer this, we need to calculate the derived measure (ratio) of Kenya's sales to overall sales, find the lowest value of this ratio, and identify the corresponding time period. The structured output captures this information by including the derived measure (share) with the applied measure (Sales), the adjective (lowest) with a negative tone, and the date variable (Order Date) with the converted time element (across 3 months).","{'MEASURE': {'sales': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'share': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'sales': 'Sales'}], 'ADJECTIVE': ['lowest'], 'TONE': 'negative'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'when': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 3 months'}]}}"

- The query mentions ""ratio of envelopes and Thailand"" which indicates a derived measure of 'ratio' involving envelopes.
- The query is asking for ""profits"" which is a measure.
- The query specifies ""across 3 years"" which is a date variable.
- The query is looking for the ""lowest"" value, which is an adjective with a negative tone.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The context provides the entity 'Envelopes' with a parent 'Sub-Category'.
- The context provides the entity 'Profit' as a measure.
- The context provides the entity 'Order Date' as a date variable.
- The context provides the entity 'ratio' as a derived measure.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query mentions ""across 3 years"" which needs to be converted to a time element.
- The context provides the date reference with start_date as '03/01/2018' and end_date as '31/12/2021'.
- The time element is calculated by considering the date reference and the ""across 3 years"" phrase from the query.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The FILTER component is created using the 'Envelopes' entity and its parent 'Sub-Category'.
- The DERIVED MEASURE component is created using the 'ratio' entity, the FILTER component with 'Envelopes', the APPLIED MEASURE component with 'Profit', the adjective 'lowest', and the tone 'negative'.
- The DATE VARIABLE component is created using the 'Order Date' entity and the CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT from Step 3.

The rationale behind this conversion is to identify all the components in the query, match them to the context, convert the date/time component, and create a structured output that accurately represents the information requested in the query.

Step 2: Match components to the context
- ""Growth rate"" can be matched to the derived measure ""Growth Rate"" in the context.
- ""Profits"" can be matched to the measure ""Profit"" in the context.
- ""Envelopes"" can be matched to the filter ""Envelopes"" with parent ""Sub-Category"" in the context.
- ""Last 10 days"" can be matched to the date variable ""Order Date"" in the context.

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- The date variable ""last 10 days"" needs to be converted to a specific date range based on the date reference provided.
- The end date is given as ""31/12/2021"", so we can calculate the start date for the last 10 days by subtracting 9 days from the end date, which gives us ""22/12/2021"".
- The converted time element for ""last 10 days"" is now the date range ""22/12/2021"" to ""31/12/2021"".

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- Previous quarter: The query asks for data from the previous quarter. To convert this, we need to find the last quarter relative to the date reference provided (start_date: '03/01/2018', end_date: '31/12/2021'). The last quarter would be the time period immediately before the end_date, which is '31/12/2021'. So, the converted time element for the previous quarter is 'last quarter'.

- In the query ""What is the profits across 3 years"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Date variable: across 3 years

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: In the context, we can find the measure 'Profit' with other names as 'profits'. So, we can match the 'profits' in the query to the 'Profit' entity in the context.
- Date variable: In the context, we have a date variable 'Order Date' with other names like 'trend', 'yoy', 'mom', 'date', 'order date', 'when', 'time'. Although the query mentions 'across 3 years', it doesn't directly match any of the other names in the context. However, we can infer that it is related to the 'Order Date' entity.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date variable in the query is 'across 3 years'. We need to convert this into a structured output format. Since the context provides a date reference with start_date as '03/01/2018' and end_date as '31/12/2021', we can use this information to convert the 'across 3 years' component.
- The date reference spans across 4 years (2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021). However, the query asks for profits across 3 years. We can assume that the query refers to the first 3 years in the date reference (2018, 2019, and 2020). So, we can convert the 'across 3 years' component to 'across years' in the structured output, considering the first 3 years in the date reference.

Step 4: Combine the matched components and converted date/time component into a structured output
- We have matched the 'profits' component to the 'Profit' entity in the context and converted the 'across 3 years' component to 'across years' considering the first 3 years in the date reference.
- Combining these components, we get the structured output as mentioned in the prompt.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'3-year': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 3 years'}]}}"

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- City: matches with the 'City' entity in the context
- Discount contribution: matches with the 'ratio' entity in the context, which is applied to the 'Discount' measure
- Greater than 20000: Comparison Value (20000) and Comparison Operator (>)

Step 3: Identify the date/time component
- The date reference is given as {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}

Step 4: Convert the query into a structured output
- DIMENSION: {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City'}]}
  - The query asks for a list of cities, so the dimension is 'City'
- DERIVED MEASURE: {'discount contribution': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount': 'Discount'}], 'DERIVED MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '20000', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}]}
  - The query asks for the discount contribution, which is the 'ratio' entity applied to the 'Discount' measure
  - The constraint is that the discount contribution should be greater than 20000, so the comparison value is '20000' and the comparison operator is '>'

Rationale:
The query asks for a list of cities with a discount contribution greater than 20000. The dimension is 'City', and the derived measure is the 'ratio' entity applied to the 'Discount' measure. The constraint is that the discount contribution should be greater than 20000, so the comparison value is '20000' and the comparison operator is '>'. The date reference is given, so no further conversion is needed for the date/time component.","{'DIMENSION': {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'discount contribution': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount': 'Discount'}], 'DERIVED MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '20000', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}]}}"

- The query mentions ""bottom cities,"" which indicates a ranking.
- The query mentions ""discount,"" which is a measure.
- The query mentions ""except guinea bissau,"" which is a filter.
- There is no explicit mention of a date or time component in the query, but we have a date reference provided.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The measure ""discount"" can be matched to the context's ""Discount"" entity.
- The dimension ""cities"" can be matched to the context's ""City"" entity.
- There is no filter entity in the context, but we can still use the filter ""except guinea bissau"" in our structured output.
- The date reference provided can be used to filter the data based on the ""Order Date"" entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert the query into a structured output
- The measure ""discount"" is added to the structured output as {'discount': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount'}]}.
- The dimension ""cities"" is added to the structured output with the ranking information as {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City', 'RANK': [{'RANK ADJECTIVE': 'bottom', 'RANK VALUE': '1'}]}]}.
- The filter ""except guinea bissau"" is not explicitly added to the structured output, but it will be applied when processing the data.
- The date reference is not explicitly added to the structured output, but it will be used to filter the data based on the ""Order Date"" entity.

Rationale:
- The query asks for the bottom cities in terms of discounts, so we need to include both the measure and the dimension in the structured output.
- The filter ""except guinea bissau"" is important to exclude a specific city from the results.
- The date reference provided will be used to filter the data based on the ""Order Date"" entity, ensuring that we only consider data within the specified date range.","{'MEASURE': {'discounts': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount', 'ADJECTIVE': ['least'], 'TONE': 'negative'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City'}]}}"

- The query asks for the ""discount"" which is a measure.
- The query mentions ""Burundi"" which is a filter.
- The query specifies ""March 2022"" which is a date variable.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The measure ""discount"" can be matched to the ""Discount"" entity in the context.
- The date variable ""March 2022"" can be matched to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date variable ""March 2022"" needs to be converted to a format that can be used in the structured output. Since the context provides a date reference with start and end dates, we can check if ""March 2022"" falls within this range. However, the end date in the context is ""31/12/2021"", which means ""March 2022"" is outside the date range. Despite this, we can still convert ""March 2022"" to a ""CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT"" as ""March 2022"" for the ""Order Date"" entity.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The measure ""discount"" is added to the structured output as {'discount': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount'}]}.
- The date variable ""March 2022"" is added to the structured output as {'march 2022': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'March 2022'}]}.

Rationale:
- The query asks for the discount of Burundi in March 2022, so we need to identify the measure, filter, and date variable components in the query.
- We match these components to the context to ensure we are using the correct entities and date references.
- The date variable ""March 2022"" is converted to a format that can be used in the structured output, even though it is outside the date range provided in the context.

- The query mentions ""first time"" which indicates a date variable.
- The query mentions ""previous quarter"" which is a date constraint.
- The query mentions ""> 50k"" which is a measure constraint.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""Discount percentage"" can be matched to the context as {'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage', 'other names': ['discount percentage'], 'dataset_id': '6538e14185a957419006d762'}.
- ""Order Date"" is the date variable in the context, which can be used for the ""first time"" component.
- There is no direct match for ""previous quarter"" in the context, but it can be derived from the date reference provided.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- The query asks for the ""previous quarter"", which means we need to find the last quarter in the date reference.
- To find the last quarter, we can look at the end_date '31/12/2021' and determine that it falls in the fourth quarter of 2021.
- Therefore, the ""previous quarter"" can be converted to {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last quarter'}.

- The query mentions ""drivers of profits,"" which can be matched to the derived measure 'kda' in the context.
- The query mentions ""envelopes,"" which can be matched to the filter entity 'Envelopes' in the context.
- The query mentions ""Thailand,"" which is a part of the 'Southeast Asia' region mentioned in the context.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The derived measure 'kda' is matched to the 'drivers' in the query.
- The filter entity 'Envelopes' is matched to the 'envelopes' in the query.
- The filter entity 'Southeast Asia' is matched to the 'Thailand' in the query, as Thailand is a part of the Southeast Asia region.

Step 3: Convert the query components into structured output
- The filter 'envelopes' is added to the structured output with its entity and parent information.
- The derived measure 'drivers' is added to the structured output with its entity and derived measure constraint information.

Step 4: Consider the date/time component
- The date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'. However, the query does not mention any specific date or time constraint.

- In the query ""Which customer id have profits more than 10k in last 10 days"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Dimension: customer id
  - Comparison value: 10k
  - Comparison operator: >
  - Date variable: last 10 days

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: In the context, we find that 'profits' is an other name for the entity 'Profit'.
- Dimension: In the context, we find that 'customer id' is an other name for the entity 'Customer ID'.
- Date variable: In the context, we find that 'Order Date' is the relevant date entity with other names such as 'date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', and 'order date'.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date variable in the query is 'last 10 days'. We need to convert this into a structured format using the 'Order Date' entity from the context. Since the date reference is given with start_date as '03/01/2018' and end_date as '31/12/2021', we can calculate the last 10 days from the end_date.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date/time component, we can now create the structured output with the following elements:
  - MEASURE: {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '10k', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}]}
  - DIMENSION: {'customer id': [{'ENTITY': 'Customer ID'}]}
  - DATE VARIABLE: {'last 10 days': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 days'}]}

- In the query ""What is the trend of share of profits of customer id across 3 years"", we can identify the following components:
  - Trend: Date variable
  - Share of profits: Derived measure
  - Customer ID: Dimension
  - Across 3 years: Date reference

Step 2: Match components to the context
- Trend: Matched to 'Order Date' in the context with other names as 'trend'.
- Share of profits: Matched to 'ratio' in the context with other names as 'share'.
- Customer ID: Matched to 'Customer ID' in the context with other names as 'customer id'.
- Across 3 years: Matched to the date reference provided with start_date as '03/01/2018' and end_date as '31/12/2021'.

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- The date reference ""across 3 years"" is converted by considering the start_date and end_date provided. In this case, the start_date is '03/01/2018' and the end_date is '31/12/2021', which represents a 3-year period.

Step 4: Create structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date/time component, the structured output is created with the following structure:

  - DIMENSION: {'customer id': [{'ENTITY': 'Customer ID'}]}
  - DERIVED MEASURE: {'share': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}
  - DATE VARIABLE: {'trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across 3 years'}]}

Rationale:
- The query asks for the trend of share of profits for customer IDs across 3 years. To answer this, we need to consider the 'Order Date' as the date variable to analyze the trend.
- The share of profits is a derived measure, which is represented by the 'ratio' entity in the context. This derived measure is applied to the 'Profit' measure.
- The dimension of interest is 'Customer ID', which is matched to the context.
- The date reference ""across 3 years"" is converted using the provided start_date and end_date, representing a 3-year period.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'customer id': [{'ENTITY': 'Customer ID'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'share': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across 3 years'}]}}"

- The query mentions ""discount highest"" which refers to the measure ""Discount"" with an adjective ""highest"" and a positive tone.
- The query mentions ""Burundi"" which is a location filter.
- The query mentions ""March 2022"" which is a date filter related to the date variable ""Order Date"".

Step 2: Match components to the context
- ""discount highest"" can be matched to the entity ""Discount"" in the context with the adjective ""highest"" and a positive tone.
- There is no direct mention of ""Burundi"" in the context, but it can be considered as a filter for the location.
- ""March 2022"" can be matched to the entity ""Order Date"" in the context.

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- The date filter ""March 2022"" needs to be converted to a time element associated with the date variable ""Order Date"". This is done by adding the ""CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT"" key with the value ""March 2022"" to the ""Order Date"" entity in the structured output.

Rationale:
- The query is asking for the highest discount in Burundi in March 2022. To answer this, we need to identify the measure ""Discount"" with the adjective ""highest"" and a positive tone, apply a location filter for ""Burundi"", and a date filter for ""March 2022"" associated with the date variable ""Order Date"". The structured output captures all these components and their relationships to the context, allowing for an accurate interpretation of the query.","{'MEASURE': {'discount': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount', 'ADJECTIVE': ['top']}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'when': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'Burundi, 03'}]}}"

- In the query ""What is the contribution of profits for product name"", we can identify the following components:
  - ""contribution"" refers to a derived measure
  - ""profits"" refers to a measure
  - ""product name"" refers to a dimension

Step 2: Match components to the context
- Match ""contribution"" to the derived measure ""ratio"" in the context, as it is listed under the 'other names' for the entity ""ratio"".
- Match ""profits"" to the measure ""Profit"" in the context, as it is listed under the 'other names' for the entity ""Profit"".
- Match ""product name"" to the dimension ""Product Name"" in the context, as it is listed under the 'other names' for the entity ""Product Name"".

Step 3: Create structured output
- For the dimension, add the matched entity ""Product Name"" with the key ""product name"".
- For the derived measure, add the matched entity ""ratio"" with the key ""contribution"" and include the applied measure ""Profit"" that was matched to ""profits"" in the query.

Step 4: Handle date/time component
- In this case, there is no explicit date/time component mentioned in the query. However, the context provides a date reference with a start date and an end date. The structured output should consider this date reference while processing the data, but it is not explicitly included in the output as it is not part of the query itself.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'product name': [{'ENTITY': 'Product Name'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'contribution': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}}"

- Growth contribution: Derived measure
- Overall discount percentage: Measure
- Countries: Dimension
- 2.5 months: Date variable

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Growth contribution: Matches with 'contribution_to_growth' in the context
- Overall discount percentage: Matches with 'Discount percentage' in the context
- Countries: Matches with 'Country' in the context
- 2.5 months: Matches with 'Order Date' in the context

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- 2.5 months need to be converted into days. Since 1 month has approximately 30 days, 2.5 months would be equal to 2.5 * 30 = 75 days.
- The date variable 'Order Date' in the context has other names like 'date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', 'order date', which can be used to represent the time period of 2.5 months or 75 days.

Rationale:
- The query asks for the growth contribution to the overall discount percentage for countries across 2.5 months. This means we need to find the contribution_to_growth for the discount percentage measure across countries.
- The date variable '2.5 months' is converted into days (75 days) to make it easier to work with and understand.
- The structured output is created by combining the matched components from the context and the converted date variable.","{'DIMENSION': {'countries': [{'ENTITY': 'Country'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'growth contribution': [{'ENTITY': 'contribution_to_growth', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount percentage': 'Discount percentage'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'across 2': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 years'}]}}"

- The query asks for ""key drivers of sale"" which is a derived measure.
- The query specifies the location ""Kenya"" which can be considered as a filter.
- There is no explicit mention of a date range in the query, so we will use the given date reference.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The derived measure ""key drivers of sale"" can be matched to the context's derived measure ""kda"" with other names like ""key driver"", ""drivers"", and ""key drivers"".
- The measure ""sale"" can be matched to the context's measure ""Sales"" with other names like ""sale"".
- The date variable ""Order Date"" can be matched to the context's date variable with other names like ""date"", ""when"", ""yoy"", ""trend"", ""mom"", ""time"", and ""order date"".

Step 3: Convert the query into a structured output
- Since the query asks for ""key drivers of sale"", we can create a derived measure with the entity ""kda"" and apply the measure ""Sales"" to it.
- As the location ""Kenya"" is mentioned in the query, we can consider it as a filter. However, since the context does not provide any information about the location, we cannot include it in the structured output.
- The date range is not explicitly mentioned in the query, so we use the given date reference with start_date as ""03/01/2018"" and end_date as ""31/12/2021"". Since the context has a date variable ""Order Date"", we can apply this date range to the structured output.

Rationale:
- The query asks for key drivers of sale, which is a derived measure in the context. By matching the terms in the query to the context, we can create a structured output that includes the derived measure with the applied measure ""Sales"".
- The location ""Kenya"" is mentioned in the query, but the context does not provide any information about it. Therefore, we cannot include it in the structured output.
- The date range is not explicitly mentioned in the query, so we use the given date reference and apply it to the date variable ""Order Date"" in the context.

- The derived measure ""share"" can be matched to the entity ""ratio"" in the context.
- The measure ""discount percentage"" is already present in the context.
- The dimension ""sub category"" can be matched to the entity ""Sub-Category"" in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query asks for the ""yearly trend"" which means we need to analyze the data across years.
- In the context, the date variable is ""Order Date"".
- So, we need to convert the ""Order Date"" variable to represent data ""across years"".

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The dimension in the output is ""sub category"" which corresponds to the entity ""Sub-Category"" in the context.
- The derived measure in the output is ""share"" which corresponds to the entity ""ratio"" in the context. It is applied to the measure ""discount percentage"" and has no constraints.
- The date variable in the output is ""yearly trend"" which is derived from the ""Order Date"" variable in the context, with the converted time element being ""across years"".

Rationale: The query asks for the yearly trend of the share of sub category discount percentage. To answer this, we need to analyze the data across years, focusing on the sub category dimension and applying the derived measure (share) to the discount percentage measure. The structured output captures this information by specifying the dimension, derived measure, and date variable with the appropriate conversions and associations to the context.","{'MEASURE': {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'subcategory': [{'ENTITY': 'Sub-Category'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'share': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount percentage': 'Discount percentage'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'yearly trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across years'}]}}"

- In the query ""What is the profits and sales by product name in 1st quarter of last year"", we can identify the following components:
  - Profits
  - Sales
  - Product Name
  - 1st quarter of last year

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Profits: In the context, we can find ""Profit"" under MEASURE with other names as ""profits"". So, we can match ""profits"" to {'ENTITY': 'Profit'}.
- Sales: In the context, we can find ""Sales"" under MEASURE with other names as ""sales"". So, we can match ""sales"" to {'ENTITY': 'Sales'}.
- Product Name: In the context, we can find ""Product Name"" under DIMENSION with other names as ""product name"". So, we can match ""product name"" to {'ENTITY': 'Product Name'}.
- 1st quarter of last year: In the context, we can find ""Order Date"" under DATE VARIABLE with other names like ""trend"", ""yoy"", ""mom"", ""date"", ""order date"", ""when"", ""time"". So, we can match ""1st quarter of last year"" to {'ENTITY': 'Order Date'}.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date component ""1st quarter of last year"" needs to be converted into a format that can be used in the structured output. We can convert it to ""quarter 1 last year"" which is a more standardized format.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date component, we can create the structured output as follows:
  - MEASURE: {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}], 'sales': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}
  - DIMENSION: {'product name': [{'ENTITY': 'Product Name'}]}
  - DATE VARIABLE: {'1st quarter of last year': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'quarter 1 last year'}]}

The rationale behind this conversion is to identify the key components in the query, match them to the context, convert the date component into a standardized format, and create a structured output that can be used for further analysis or processing.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}], 'sales': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'product name': [{'ENTITY': 'Product Name'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'previous year': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last year'}]}}"

- DIMENSION: Since the query asks for the top ship mode, we need to rank the Ship Mode dimension based on the correlation of sales. We add the RANK information to the Ship Mode entity.
- DERIVED MEASURE: The query asks for the correlation of sales between Kenya and South Korea. We apply the correlation derived measure to the Sales measure and add a constraint for the countries Kenya and South Korea.
- DATE VARIABLE: The query asks for the correlation in the last 15 days. We convert the ""15d"" into ""last 15 days"" and apply it to the Order Date entity.

Rationale:
- The query asks for the top ship mode based on the correlation of sales between Kenya and South Korea in the last 15 days. We need to rank the Ship Mode dimension based on the correlation of sales.
- The correlation is a derived measure that needs to be applied to the Sales measure. We also need to add a constraint for the countries Kenya and South Korea.

- In the query ""When was contribution of discount of cities highest"", we can identify the following components:
  - ""contribution"" refers to a derived measure
  - ""discount"" refers to a measure
  - ""cities"" refers to a dimension
  - ""highest"" refers to an adjective describing the derived measure
  - ""When"" refers to a date variable

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- From the context, we can match the components as follows:
  - ""contribution"" matches with the derived measure ""ratio""
  - ""discount"" matches with the measure ""Discount""
  - ""cities"" matches with the dimension ""City""
  - ""highest"" remains as an adjective
  - ""When"" matches with the date variable ""Order Date""

- The query mentions ""1st quarter of last year"" which is a date reference that needs to be converted.
- The query mentions ""when"" which can be matched to the 'Order Date' entity in the context.

Step 2: Match components to the context
- 'profits' is matched to the 'Profit' entity in the context.
- 'highest' is matched to the 'Profit' entity as an adjective with a positive tone.
- 'El Salvador' is not directly mentioned in the context, but it can be inferred as a filter for the data.
- '1st quarter of last year' needs to be converted to a proper date range.
- 'when' is matched to the 'Order Date' entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- '1st quarter of last year' is converted to 'quarter 1 last year' which corresponds to a date range. Since the date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021', 'last year' would refer to '2020'. Therefore, 'quarter 1 last year' would correspond to the date range '01/01/2020' to '31/03/2020'.

Step 4: Create structured output
- The 'Profit' entity is associated with the adjective 'highest' and a positive tone.
- The 'Order Date' entity is associated with the converted time element 'quarter 1 last year' and the original 'when' entity.
- The filter for 'El Salvador' is not directly mentioned in the context, but it can be inferred and added to the structured output as a filter.

- In the query ""What is the profits, discounts, and profits across 3 years"", we can identify the following components:
  - Profits (measure)
  - Discounts (measure)
  - Across 3 years (date variable)

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Match ""profits"" to the context: {'ENTITY': 'Profit', 'other names': ['profits']}
- Match ""discounts"" to the context: {'ENTITY': 'Discount', 'other names': ['discounts'], 'dataset_id': '6538e14185a957419006d762_2'}
- Match ""across 3 years"" to the context: {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'other names': ['trend', 'yoy', 'mom', 'date', 'order date', 'when', 'time']}

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}
- The query asks for data ""across 3 years"", which can be interpreted as the last 3 years from the end date in the date reference.
- Calculate the last 3 years: 31/12/2021 - 3 years = 31/12/2018
- Convert ""across 3 years"" to {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 3 years'}

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Combine the matched components and the converted date/time component to create the structured output:

- Forecast: Indicates a prediction or estimation
- Monthly discount: Refers to the measure 'Discount' with a monthly frequency
- Burundi: A location, but not mentioned in the context, so we can ignore it
- March 2022: A specific date or time period

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Monthly discount: Matches with the 'Discount' entity in the context
- March 2022: Doesn't directly match with any date variable in the context, but can be converted to a suitable format

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- March 2022: Convert it to a format that matches the 'Order Date' entity in the context, which is 'March 2022'

Step 4: Create the structured output
- MEASURE: {'discount': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount', 'ADJECTIVE': ['monthly']}]}
- DATE VARIABLE: {'march 2022': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'March 2022'}]}

Rationale:
- The query asks for a forecast of the monthly discount in March 2022, so we need to include the 'Discount' measure with a monthly frequency.
- The date component 'March 2022' is converted to match the 'Order Date' entity in the context, which helps in understanding the time period for the forecast.","{'MEASURE': {'discount': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'monthly': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across months'}]}}"

- The query mentions ""discount percentage"", which can be matched to the 'Discount percentage' entity in the context.
- The query mentions ""sub category"", which can be matched to the 'Sub-Category' entity in the context.
- The query mentions ""lowest"", which can be considered as a filter or adjective for the 'Sub-Category' entity.
- The query mentions ""first time"", which is a date/time component related to the 'Order Date' entity in the context.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The 'Discount percentage' entity in the context is matched to the 'discount percentage' mentioned in the query.
- The 'Sub-Category' entity in the context is matched to the 'sub category' mentioned in the query.
- The 'Order Date' entity in the context is matched to the 'first time' mentioned in the query.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The 'first time' mentioned in the query is a date/time component that needs to be converted to a structured output. In this case, it is related to the 'Order Date' entity in the context, so we can convert it to {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'first time'}.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the identified components and their matches in the context, we can create the structured output as follows:
  - 'MEASURE': {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage'}]}
  - 'DIMENSION': {'sub category': [{'ENTITY': 'Sub-Category', 'ADJECTIVE': ['lowest'], 'TONE': 'negative'}]}
  - 'DATE VARIABLE': {'when': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'first time'}]}

Rationale:
- The query is asking for the first time when the discount percentage of a sub-category was the lowest. To answer this, we need to consider the 'Discount percentage' measure, the 'Sub-Category' dimension with the adjective 'lowest', and the 'Order Date' date variable with the converted time element 'first time'. By structuring the output in this way, we can accurately represent the components of the query and their relationships to the context.","{'MEASURE': {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage', 'ADJECTIVE': ['lowest'], 'TONE': 'negative'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'sub-category': [{'ENTITY': 'Sub-Category'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'when': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': '1st time'}]}}"

- In the query ""When was contribution of profits of customer id lowest"", we can identify the following components:
  - ""contribution of profits"" refers to a derived measure
  - ""customer id"" refers to a dimension
  - ""lowest"" refers to an adjective describing the derived measure
  - ""When"" refers to a date variable

Step 2: Match components to the context
- From the context, we can match the following components:
  - ""profits"" can be matched to the 'Profit' entity under 'MEASURE'
  - ""customer id"" can be matched to the 'Customer ID' entity under 'DIMENSION'
  - ""contribution"" can be matched to the 'ratio' entity under 'DERIVED MEASURE'
  - ""When"" can be matched to the 'Order Date' entity under 'DATE VARIABLE'

Step 3: Incorporate the adjective and tone
- The adjective ""lowest"" is associated with the derived measure 'contribution'. We can add this adjective to the structured output under the 'contribution' entity.
- Since ""lowest"" has a negative connotation, we can also add a 'TONE' attribute with the value 'negative' to the 'contribution' entity.

Step 4: Apply the derived measure to the identified measure
- The derived measure 'contribution' is applied to the measure 'profits'. We can add an 'APPLIED MEASURE' attribute to the 'contribution' entity with the value {'profits': 'Profit'}.

Step 5: Convert the date/time component
- The date variable ""when"" is matched to the 'Order Date' entity in the context. In the structured output, we can add the 'when' key with the value [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date'}].

By following these steps, we have successfully converted the query into a structured output that captures all the relevant components and their relationships.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'customer id': [{'ENTITY': 'Customer ID', 'RANK': [{'RANK ADJECTIVE': 'lowest', 'RANK VALUE': '1'}]}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'contribution': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'when': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date'}]}}"

- ""contributing to growth"" matches to ""contribution_to_growth"" in the context
- ""profits"" matches to ""Profit"" in the context
- ""across 2 months"" matches to ""Order Date"" in the context

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- ""across 2 months"" is converted to ""last 2 months"" for the ""Order Date"" entity in the context, as it refers to a period of 2 months.

Rationale:
- The query asks for the number of product names that contribute to the growth of profits in a 2-month period.
- The components in the query are matched to the context to ensure the correct entities are used in the structured output.

- In the query ""Why profits of el salvador changed in 1st quarter of last year"", we can identify the following components:
  - Profits: Measure
  - El Salvador: Filter (not mentioned in the context, but can be inferred)
  - Changed: Derived Measure (Growth Rate)
  - 1st quarter of last year: Date Variable

Step 2: Match components to the context
- Profits: Matched to 'Profit' in the context under 'MEASURE'
- Changed: Matched to 'Growth Rate' in the context under 'DERIVED MEASURE'
- 1st quarter of last year: Matched to 'Order Date' in the context under 'DATE VARIABLE'

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- The date component ""1st quarter of last year"" is converted to 'quarter 1 last year' in the structured output. This is done by understanding that ""1st quarter"" refers to the first quarter of a year and ""last year"" refers to the previous year. Combining these two pieces of information, we get 'quarter 1 last year' as the converted time element.

- In the query, we can identify the following components: profits, sales, discount percentage, and 1st quarter of last year.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Profits can be matched to the 'Profit' entity in the context.
- Sales can be matched to the 'Sales' entity in the context.
- Discount percentage can be matched to the 'Discount percentage' entity in the context.
- 1st quarter of last year can be matched to the 'Order Date' entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date component ""1st quarter of last year"" needs to be converted into a structured format. Since the context provides a date reference with start and end dates, we can calculate the last year by subtracting 1 from the end date's year (2021 - 1 = 2020). Then, we can represent the 1st quarter of last year as 'quarter 1 last year' in the structured output.

Step 4: Combine the matched components and converted date component into a structured output
- The structured output should include the matched entities for profits, sales, and discount percentage, as well as the converted date component for the 1st quarter of last year.

- ""15d"" is not a standard date format, but it can be inferred as ""last 15 days"" based on the context and the date reference provided.

Step 4: Create structured output
- DERIVED MEASURE: Use the ""ratio"" entity and apply the ""Sales"" measure to it.
- FILTER: Add a filter for the country ""Kenya"".
- DATE VARIABLE: Use the ""Order Date"" entity and convert the time element to ""last 15 days"".

Rationale:
The query asks for the percentage of sales in Kenya compared to the overall sales in the last 15 days. To answer this, we need to calculate the ratio of sales in Kenya to the overall sales. We identified the components in the query and matched them to the context. We then converted the date/time component ""15d"" to ""last 15 days"" and created the structured output accordingly.","{'DERIVED MEASURE': {'%': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'sale': 'Sales'}]}]}}"

- The query asks for the time when the contribution of profits of envelopes was the lowest. The components identified are:
  - Contribution of profits (a derived measure)
  - Envelopes (a filter)
  - Lowest (an adjective)
  - Time (a date variable)

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Contribution of profits: In the context, the derived measure 'ratio' has an alternative name 'contribution', which matches the query component.
- Envelopes: In the context, the filter 'Envelopes' has an alternative name 'envelopes', which matches the query component.
- Lowest: This adjective is not explicitly mentioned in the context, but it can be inferred as a tone (negative) for the derived measure.
- Time: In the context, the date variable 'Order Date' has an alternative name 'when', which matches the query component.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query asks for the time when the contribution was the lowest. In the context, the date variable 'Order Date' is used to represent time. Therefore, the date variable 'when' is used in the structured output to represent the time component.

- Measure: ""sale"" matches with ""Sales"" in the context
- Dimension: ""ship mode"" matches with ""Ship Mode"" in the context
- Derived Measure: ""contributing to growth"" matches with ""contribution_to_growth"" in the context
- Date Variable: ""15d"" needs to be converted to a proper date range

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- ""15d"" refers to the last 15 days. Since the end date in the date reference is ""31/12/2021"", the last 15 days would be from ""17/12/2021"" to ""31/12/2021"". So, the date variable is converted to ""last 15 days"" for the ""Order Date"" entity.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- For each component identified in Step 1, add the corresponding entity from the context to the structured output.
- For the derived measure, also include the applied measure, which is ""Sales"" in this case.
- For the date variable, include the converted time element ""last 15 days"" for the ""Order Date"" entity.

Rationale: The query asks for the number of ship modes contributing to the growth of sales in the last 15 days.

So, we convert the ""across 2 months"" component to {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 months'}.

Step 4: Structure the output
Now that we have matched the components to the context and converted the date/time component, we can structure the output as follows:
- MEASURE: {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage'}], 'shipping cost': [{'ENTITY': 'Shipping Cost'}], 'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}
- DATE VARIABLE: {'2 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 months'}]}

Rationale:
The query asks for three measures (discount percentage, shipping cost, and profits) across a specific time period (2 months). We identified these components and matched them to the context provided. We then converted the date/time component based on the date reference given. Finally, we structured the output to include the identified measures and the converted date/time component.","{'MEASURE': {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage'}], 'shipping cost': [{'ENTITY': 'Shipping Cost'}], 'profit': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'2-month': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 months'}]}}"

- Top grown: Rank adjective and rank value (top 1)
- Customer ID: Dimension
- Profits: Measure
- Last 10 days: Date variable

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Customer ID: Matched to ""Customer ID"" in the context
- Profits: Matched to ""Profit"" in the context
- Growth Rate: Matched to ""Growth Rate"" in the context
- Order Date: Matched to ""Order Date"" in the context (as it is the only date variable)

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- Last 10 days: Since the date reference is given as {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}, we can convert ""last 10 days"" to a specific date range by subtracting 10 days from the end_date. This gives us the converted time element 'last 10 days'.

Step 4: Structure the output
- MEASURE: Map ""profits"" to the entity ""Profit"" from the context
- DIMENSION: Map ""customer id"" to the entity ""Customer ID"" from the context, and include the rank adjective and rank value (top 1)
- DERIVED MEASURE: Map ""grown"" to the entity ""Growth Rate"" from the context, and specify that it is applied to the measure ""Profit""
- DATE VARIABLE: Map ""last 10 days"" to the entity ""Order Date"" from the context, and include the converted time element 'last 10 days'

The rationale behind this conversion is to identify all the components in the query, match them to the context, convert the date/time component, and then structure the output accordingly. This ensures that all relevant information from the query is captured and represented in a structured format.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'customer id': [{'ENTITY': 'Customer ID', 'RANK': [{'RANK ADJECTIVE': 'top', 'RANK VALUE': '1'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'past 10 days': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 days'}]}}"

- The query mentions ""profits of envelopes,"" which refers to the measure 'Profit' and the filter 'Envelopes.'
- The query also mentions ""more than 10k,"" which is a constraint on the measure 'Profit.'
- The query specifies ""in the last 10 days,"" which is a date constraint on the 'Order Date.'
- The query asks for ""the first time,"" which indicates the need for a date variable.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- 'profits' can be matched to the 'Profit' entity in the context.
- 'envelopes' can be matched to the 'Envelopes' entity in the context.
- 'time' or 'when' can be matched to the 'Order Date' entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query mentions ""in the last 10 days,"" which is a relative time constraint. We need to convert this into an absolute time range using the given date reference.
- The date reference has a start date of '03/01/2018' and an end date of '31/12/2021.'
- To convert ""in the last 10 days"" to an absolute time range, we need to subtract 10 days from the end date '31/12/2021.' This gives us a new start date of '21/12/2021.'
- The new time range for the query is from '21/12/2021' to '31/12/2021.'

Step 4: Structure the output
- The measure 'profits' is associated with the 'Profit' entity and has a constraint of '>' and a comparison value of '10000.'
- The filter 'envelopes' is associated with the 'Envelopes' entity and has a parent 'Sub-Category.'
- The date variable 'when' is associated with the 'Order Date' entity and has a converted time element of 'last 10 days,' which corresponds to the absolute time range '21/12/2021' to '31/12/2021.'

- The query mentions ""discount greater than 20000"" which can be matched to the ""Discount"" entity in the context and has a comparison value of 20000 and a comparison operator of '>'.
- The query mentions ""march 2022"" which can be matched to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context and needs to be converted to a time element.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The ""cities"" in the query can be matched to the ""City"" entity in the context under the 'DIMENSION' key.
- The ""discount greater than 20000"" in the query can be matched to the ""Discount"" entity in the context under the 'MEASURE' key, with the comparison value and operator added as constraints.
- The ""march 2022"" in the query can be matched to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context under the 'DATE VARIABLE' key.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The ""march 2022"" in the query needs to be converted to a time element that can be used in the structured output.
- Since the date reference provided has a start date of '03/01/2018' and an end date of '31/12/2021', we can infer that the date format used is 'DD/MM/YYYY'.
- Based on this format, we can convert ""march 2022"" to ""March 2022"" as a time element to be used in the structured output under the 'DATE VARIABLE' key.

Rationale:
- The query asks for cities with a discount greater than 20000 in March 2022, so we need to identify and match the components in the query to the context provided.
- By matching the components to the context and converting the date/time component, we can create a structured output that accurately represents the information requested in the query.","{'MEASURE': {'discounts': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '20000', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'March 2022': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'March 2022'}]}}"

- In the query ""When was the first time that discount percentage of haiti was lowest"", we can identify the following components:
  - Discount percentage (measure)
  - Haiti (filter)
  - Lowest (adjective)
  - First time (date/time component)

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Discount percentage: From the context, we can see that ""Discount percentage"" is an entity with dataset_id '6538e14185a957419006d762'.
- Haiti: This component is not present in the context, but it is a filter that needs to be applied to the data.
- Lowest: This adjective can be matched to the 'Low' entity in the context, which is a parent of 'Order Priority'.
- First time: This date/time component can be matched to the 'Order Date' entity in the context, which has other names like 'time' and 'when'.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date/time component ""first time"" can be converted to the 'Order Date' entity in the context. Since the query is asking for the first occurrence of the lowest discount percentage, we can use the 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' attribute with the value 'first time' for the 'Order Date' entity.

Rationale:
- The query is asking for the first time when the discount percentage was lowest. To answer this, we need to find the minimum value of the discount percentage and then find the first occurrence of this minimum value in the dataset.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- ""1st quarter of last year"" is a specific time period that needs to be converted into a date range. Since the date reference is given as {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}, we can determine that ""last year"" refers to 2020. Therefore, the 1st quarter of last year would be the date range from 01/01/2020 to 31/03/2020.

- ""lowest profits contribution to growth"": This is a derived measure with an adjective ""lowest"" and a tone ""negative"".
- ""customer id"": This is a dimension.
- ""last 10 days"": This is a date variable.

Step 2: Match components to the context
- ""profits contribution to growth"" can be matched to the derived measure ""contribution_to_growth"" in the context, with the applied measure ""profits"" which corresponds to the ""Profit"" entity in the context.
- ""customer id"" can be matched to the dimension ""Customer ID"" in the context.
- ""last 10 days"" can be matched to the date variable ""Order Date"" in the context.

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- ""last 10 days"" is a relative time period, which can be converted using the date reference provided. Since the end date is '31/12/2021', the last 10 days would be from '22/12/2021' to '31/12/2021'.

Step 4: Assemble the structured output
- The structured output is created by combining the matched components from the context and the converted date/time component:
  - DIMENSION: {'customer id': [{'ENTITY': 'Customer ID'}]}
  - DERIVED MEASURE: {'profits contribution to growth': [{'ENTITY': 'contribution_to_growth', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}], 'ADJECTIVE': ['lowest'], 'TONE': 'negative'}]}
  - DATE VARIABLE: {'last 10 days': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 days'}]}

The rationale behind this conversion is to identify the relevant components in the query, match them to the context, convert the date/time component, and assemble the structured output using the matched components and the converted date/time component. This allows for a clear and structured representation of the query, making it easier to process and analyze.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'customer id': [{'ENTITY': 'Customer ID', 'RANK': [{'RANK ADJECTIVE': 'bottom', 'RANK VALUE': '1'}]}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'growth': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}], 'ADJECTIVE': ['lowest'], 'TONE': 'negative'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'when': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 days'}]}}"

- DERIVED MEASURE: Include the 'contribution_to_growth' entity, applying the 'Discount' measure, and without any constraints
- DATE VARIABLE: Include the 'Order Date' entity with the converted time element 'last 2 months'

Rationale:
- The query asks for the bottom cities based on growth contribution to overall discount across 2 months. This means we need to rank cities based on their contribution to growth in discounts over the last 2 months.
- We identify the relevant entities from the context and match them to the components in the query.
- The date component ""across 2 months"" is converted to ""last 2 months"" to specify the time range for the analysis.

- In the query ""What is the contribution of envelopes for profits"", we can identify the following components:
  - Contribution (Derived Measure)
  - Envelopes (Filter)
  - Profits (Measure)

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Contribution: In the context, we can find the derived measure ""ratio"" with other names including ""contribution"". So, we can match ""contribution"" to the derived measure ""ratio"".
- Envelopes: In the context, we can find the filter ""Envelopes"" with other names including ""envelopes"" and parent ""Sub-Category"". So, we can match ""envelopes"" to the filter ""Envelopes"".
- Profits: In the context, we can find the measure ""Profit"" with other names including ""profits"". So, we can match ""profits"" to the measure ""Profit"".

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}. Since there is no specific date or time mentioned in the query, we can assume that the query is asking for the contribution of envelopes for profits within the given date range.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the matched components and the date range, we can create the structured output as follows:
  - MEASURE: {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}

  - DERIVED MEASURE: {'contribution': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'RATIO FILTER': [{'envelopes': 'Envelopes'}], 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}

Rationale:
- The query is asking for the contribution of envelopes for profits. So, we need to calculate the ratio (derived measure) of profits (measure) for envelopes (filter) within the given date range.

- In the query ""What is the contribution of Burundi for discount?"", the main components are ""contribution"", ""Burundi"", and ""discount"".

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""Contribution"" can be matched to the derived measure ""ratio"" in the context, as it has the other name ""contribution"".
- ""Discount"" can be matched to the measure ""Discount"" in the context, as it is the same entity.
- ""Burundi"" is not explicitly mentioned in the context, but it can be inferred that it is a filter or dimension value related to the data.

Step 3: Create the structured output
- The derived measure ""contribution"" is the main focus of the query, so it is included in the structured output.
- The applied measure ""discount"" is related to the derived measure ""contribution"", so it is included as a sub-component of the derived measure.
- Since ""Burundi"" is not explicitly mentioned in the context, it is not included in the structured output. However, it can be inferred that it is a filter or dimension value that should be applied to the data when calculating the contribution.

Step 4: Consider the date/time component
- The date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'.

- The query mentions ""trend of sale,"" which refers to the measure 'Sales.'
- It also mentions ""all ship mode,"" which refers to the dimension 'Ship Mode.'
- The query specifies ""except democratic republic of the congo,"" which is a filter condition.
- The date reference is given as {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The measure 'Sales' can be matched to the context as {'ENTITY': 'Sales'}.
- The dimension 'Ship Mode' can be matched to the context as {'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode'}.
- The filter condition is not explicitly mentioned in the context, but it can be inferred that it should be applied to the 'Ship Mode' dimension.
- The date variable 'Order Date' can be matched to the context as {'ENTITY': 'Order Date'}.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference is given as {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- The query mentions ""trend,"" which implies a time-based analysis.
- The 'Order Date' variable in the context has 'trend' as one of its other names.
- Therefore, the date variable 'Order Date' is converted to the time element 'trend' in the structured output.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The measure 'Sales' is added to the output as {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}.
- The dimension 'Ship Mode' is added to the output as {'ship mode': [{'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode'}]}.
- The date variable 'Order Date' with the converted time element 'trend' is added to the output as {'trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'trend'}]}.

Rationale:
The query asks for the trend of sales for all ship modes except for one specific country. The structured output captures the measure (sales), dimension (ship mode), and date variable (order date with the converted time element 'trend') to answer this question. The filter condition is not explicitly mentioned in the context, but it can be inferred that it should be applied to the 'Ship Mode' dimension.","{'MEASURE': {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'ship mode': [{'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'trend'}]}}"

- The query asks for the yearly trend of discount percentage and sales.
- It specifies a time frame of the last 10 months.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- 'Discount percentage' and 'Sales' are both mentioned in the context under 'MEASURE'.
- 'Yearly trend' and 'last 10 months' are related to the 'Order Date' entity under 'DATE VARIABLE'.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query asks for the yearly trend, which means we need to analyze the data across years. This is represented by the 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across years'.
- The query also specifies the last 10 months, which is represented by the 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 months'.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The 'MEASURE' section includes 'Sales' and 'Discount percentage' entities.
- The 'DERIVED MEASURE' section includes the 'ratio' entity, which is applied to both 'Sales' and 'Discount percentage' to calculate the percentage.
- The 'DATE VARIABLE' section includes the 'Order Date' entity with the 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' values 'across years' and 'last 10 months'.

Rationale:
The structured output is created by identifying the relevant components in the query and matching them to the context. The date/time components are converted to represent the desired time frame (yearly trend and last 10 months).

Last 10 days' profits?,What is the profits in last 10 days,what,"{'MEASURE': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit', 'other names': ['profits']}], 'DIMENSION': [], 'FILTER': [], 'DERIVED MEASURE': [], 'DATE VARIABLE': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'other names': ['trend', 'yoy', 'mom', 'date', 'order date', 'when', 'time']}]}","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'last 10 days': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 days'}]}}","Step 1: Identify the components in the query
- In the query ""What is the profits in last 10 days"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Date variable: last 10 days

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: The context provides a measure called ""Profit"" with other names including ""profits"". So, we can match the measure ""profits"" in the query to the ""Profit"" entity in the context.
- Date variable: The context provides a date variable called ""Order Date"" with other names including ""trend"", ""yoy"", ""mom"", ""date"", ""order date"", ""when"", ""time"". Although the query's date variable ""last 10 days"" is not directly mentioned in the context, we can infer that it is related to the ""Order Date"" entity.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date variable in the query is ""last 10 days"". We need to convert this into a structured output format. Since the context provides a date reference with start and end dates, we can use this information to calculate the last 10 days from the end date.
- The end date in the date reference is '31/12/2021'. So, the last 10 days would be the time period between '22/12/2021' and '31/12/2021'.
- We can now represent this date variable as a converted time element in the structured output format: {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 days'}

Step 4: Combine the matched components and converted date variable into the structured output
- Finally, we can combine the matched measure and the converted date variable into the structured output format:

- The query asks for the ""contribution of discount percentage"" which is a derived measure.
- The query specifies the dimension as ""sub category"".

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- In the context, we find the derived measure ""ratio"" with other names including ""contribution"" and ""percentage"". This matches the ""contribution of discount percentage"" in the query.
- In the context, we also find the dimension ""Sub-Category"" with other names including ""sub category"". This matches the ""sub category"" in the query.

Step 3: Create the structured output
- For the dimension, we include ""sub category"" and map it to the entity ""Sub-Category"" from the context.
- For the derived measure, we include ""contribution"" and map it to the entity ""ratio"" from the context. We also specify that the applied measure is ""discount percentage"", which maps to the entity ""Discount percentage"" in the context.

Step 4: Consider the date/time component
- The date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'. However, the query does not specifically ask for any date-related information, so we do not need to include the date component in the structured output.

Rationale:
- The query asks for the contribution of discount percentage for sub category, which can be interpreted as the ratio of discount percentage for each sub category.
- By matching the components in the query to the context, we can create a structured output that accurately represents the information requested in the query.","{'DIMENSION': {'sub category': [{'ENTITY': 'Sub-Category'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'contribution': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount %': 'Discount percentage'}]}]}}"

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Share of countries: Matched to 'ratio' in the context under 'DERIVED MEASURE'
- Overall discount percentage: Matched to 'Discount percentage' in the context under 'MEASURE'
- Lowest: Rank adjective, no direct match in the context but can be used for ranking
- Across 2.5 months: No direct match in the context, but can be converted to a date range using the date reference provided

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query asks for the lowest share across 2.5 months. Since the end date in the date reference is 31/12/2021, we can calculate the last 2.5 months by subtracting 2.5 months from the end date. This gives us a new date range to consider for the analysis.

- In the query, we can identify the following components: ""contribution"", ""envelopes"", ""Thailand"", ""overall profits"", and ""across 3 years"".

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""contribution"" can be matched to the derived measure ""ratio"" in the context.
- ""envelopes"" can be matched to the filter ""Envelopes"" with the parent ""Sub-Category"" in the context.
- ""Thailand"" can be matched to the filter ""Southeast Asia"" with the parent ""Region"" in the context, as Thailand is a part of Southeast Asia.
- ""overall profits"" can be matched to the measure ""Profit"" in the context.
- ""across 3 years"" can be matched to the date variable ""Order Date"" in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'.
- The query asks for the contribution ""across 3 years"". Since the end date is '31/12/2021', we can assume that the query is asking for the last 3 years from the end date.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Monthly trend: In the context, we have ""Order Date"" as the date variable with other names including ""trend"". So, we can match ""monthly trend"" to ""Order Date"".
- Contribution: In the context, we have ""ratio"" as a derived measure with other names including ""contribution"". So, we can match ""contribution"" to ""ratio"".
- Cities: In the context, we have ""City"" as a dimension with other names including ""cities"". So, we can match ""cities"" to ""City"".
- Discount: In the context, we have ""Discount"" as a measure with other names including ""discounts"" and ""discount"". So, we can match ""discount"" to ""Discount"".

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- In the query, the date/time component is ""monthly trend"". Since we have matched it to ""Order Date"" in the context, we need to convert it to represent the monthly trend.
- To do this, we can use the ""CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT"" attribute and set it to ""across months"" for the ""Order Date"" entity. This will ensure that the structured output captures the monthly trend aspect of the query.

Step 4: Incorporate the derived measure
- In the query, the derived measure is ""contribution"". Since we have matched it to ""ratio"" in the context, we need to incorporate it into the structured output.
- To do this, we can use the ""APPLIED MEASURE"" attribute for the ""ratio"" entity and set it to the measure ""Discount"". This will ensure that the structured output captures the contribution aspect of the query with respect to the discount measure.

Step 5: Combine all components into the structured output

- The measure ""discount"" can be matched to the entity ""Discount"" in the context.
- The dimension ""cities"" can be matched to the entity ""City"" in the context.
- The adjective ""highest"" can be matched to the filter entity ""High"" in the context, which has a parent ""Order Priority.""
- The date/time component ""first time"" can be matched to the entity ""Order Date"" in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'.
- The query asks for the ""first time"" the discount was highest, so we need to consider the entire date range.
- The ""first time"" can be represented as ""from start to end"" in the structured output.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The measure ""discount"" is represented with the entity ""Discount"" and the adjective ""highest"" with a positive tone.
- The dimension ""cities"" is represented with the entity ""City.""
- The date variable ""first time"" is represented with the entity ""Order Date"" and the converted time element ""from start to end.""

- In the query ""List of product name basis percentage of profits"", we can identify the following components:
  - Product Name (Dimension)
  - Percentage of profits (Derived Measure)

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Match ""product name"" to the context: {'ENTITY': 'Product Name', 'other names': ['product name']}
- Match ""percentage of profits"" to the context: {'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'other names': ['percentage']}

Step 3: Identify the base measure for the derived measure
- The derived measure ""percentage of profits"" is based on the measure ""profits"". So, we need to match ""profits"" to the context: {'ENTITY': 'Profit', 'other names': ['profits']}

Step 4: Create the structured output
- For the dimension ""product name"", add the matched context: {'product name': [{'ENTITY': 'Product Name'}]}
- For the measure ""profits"", add the matched context: {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}

- The query mentions ""discount percentage"" which is a measure.
- The query mentions ""Haiti"" which is a dimension.
- The query mentions ""greater than 20000"" which is a measure constraint.
- The query mentions ""first time"" which is related to the date variable.
- The query mentions ""last 10 months"" which is a time constraint.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""discount percentage"" matches the entity ""Discount percentage"" in the context.
- ""Haiti"" is not mentioned in the context, but it is a dimension that needs to be considered.
- ""greater than 20000"" is a measure constraint that needs to be applied to the ""Discount percentage"" entity.
- ""first time"" is related to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context.
- ""last 10 months"" is a time constraint that needs to be applied to the ""Order Date"" entity.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query mentions ""last 10 months"", which is a relative time constraint. To convert this, we need to consider the date reference provided, which has a start date of ""03/01/2018"" and an end date of ""31/12/2021"".
- Since the query is asking for the last 10 months, we need to calculate the start date for this time period. We can do this by subtracting 10 months from the end date ""31/12/2021"". This gives us a new start date for the time constraint.
- The ""first time"" mentioned in the query refers to the earliest ""Order Date"" within this time constraint where the measure constraint is satisfied.

Step 4: Structure the output
- The structured output should include the ""Discount percentage"" entity with the measure constraint of ""greater than 20000"".
- The output should also include the ""Order Date"" entity with the converted time element of ""last 10 months"".
- The dimension ""Haiti"" should be included in the output as well, even though it is not mentioned in the context.","{'MEASURE': {'discount percentage': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount percentage', 'MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '20000', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': '>'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'when': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 months'}]}}"

- The query asks for a list of product names.
- The query specifies a condition for profits to be more than 10k.
- The query asks for the bottom product name based on the specified condition.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The context provides the entity 'Product Name' which matches the 'product name' component in the query.
- The context provides the entity 'Profit' which matches the 'profits' component in the query.
- The context provides the entity 'Order Date' which can be used to filter the data based on the date reference.

Step 3: Convert the query components into structured output
- The 'profits' component is converted into a measure constraint with a comparison value of 10000 and a comparison operator of '>'.
- The 'product name' component is converted into a dimension with a rank adjective 'bottom' and a rank value of '1'.
- The date reference is used to filter the data based on the 'Order Date' entity.

- In the query ""What is the profits of customer id except ireland across 3 years"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Dimension: customer id
  - Filter: except ireland
  - Date/Time component: across 3 years

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: ""profits"" can be matched to the context as {'ENTITY': 'Profit', 'other names': ['profits']}
- Dimension: ""customer id"" can be matched to the context as {'ENTITY': 'Customer ID', 'other names': ['customer id']}
- Filter: ""except ireland"" can be matched to the context as {'ENTITY': 'Country', 'other names': ['country']}
- Date/Time component: ""across 3 years"" can be matched to the context as {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'other names': ['trend', 'yoy', 'mom', 'date', 'order date', 'when', 'time']}

- In the query ""What is the profits of el salvador in 1st quarter of last year"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: profits
  - Date variable: 1st quarter of last year
  - Filter: el salvador

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: ""profits"" can be matched to the ""Profit"" entity in the context, as it is listed as an alternative name.
- Date variable: ""1st quarter of last year"" can be matched to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context, as it is a date-related term.
- Filter: ""el salvador"" is not explicitly mentioned in the context, but it can be inferred as a filter for the data.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date variable ""1st quarter of last year"" needs to be converted into a structured format. Since the context provides a date reference with start and end dates, we can use this information to determine the specific time period for ""last year"".
- Given the end date of ""31/12/2021"", ""last year"" would refer to the year 2020.
- Therefore, ""1st quarter of last year"" can be converted into a structured format as ""quarter 1 last year"", which corresponds to the time period from 01/01/2020 to 31/03/2020.

Step 4: Combine the matched components and converted date variable into a structured output
- The structured output should include the matched measure, date variable, and filter.
- Measure: {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}
- Date variable: {'1st quarter of last year': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'quarter 1 last year'}]}

In the given query ""What will be sale in 15d"", we can identify the following components:
- Measure: sale
- Date variable: 15d

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Measure: The term ""sale"" can be matched to the entity ""Sales"" in the context under 'MEASURE'.
- Date variable: The term ""15d"" refers to a time period of 15 days. However, there is no direct match in the context. We need to convert this into a meaningful date variable.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- Date variable: Since the query asks for sales in 15 days, we can interpret this as the sales in the last 15 days. We can convert ""15d"" into ""last 15 days"" and associate it with the entity ""Order Date"" in the context under 'DATE VARIABLE'.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- MEASURE: Map the identified measure ""sale"" to the entity ""Sales"" in the context.
- DATE VARIABLE: Map the converted date variable ""last 15 days"" to the entity ""Order Date"" in the context.

- The query mentions ""bottom product name for profits,"" which indicates a ranking of product names based on profits.
- The query also mentions ""except Slovenia and Ecuador,"" which implies a filter to exclude these countries.
- There is no explicit mention of a date or time component in the query.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The context provides the entity ""Profit"" with the other name ""profits,"" which matches the ""profits"" mentioned in the query.
- The context also provides the entity ""Product Name"" with the other name ""product name,"" which matches the ""product name"" mentioned in the query.

Step 3: Create the structured output
- The MEASURE component is identified as ""profits,"" which corresponds to the entity ""Profit"" in the context.
- The DIMENSION component is identified as ""product name,"" which corresponds to the entity ""Product Name"" in the context. Additionally, the query mentions ""bottom,"" indicating a ranking, so we add the ""RANK"" attribute with the ""RANK ADJECTIVE"" as ""bottom"" and the ""RANK VALUE"" as ""1"" (since the query does not specify a specific number of bottom products).

Step 4: Handle the date/time component
- Although the query does not explicitly mention a date or time component, the date reference provided indicates a start date of ""03/01/2018"" and an end date of ""31/12/2021."" Since the query does not contradict or provide additional information about the date range, we can assume that the structured output should consider this date range.

Step 5: Handle the filter component
- The query mentions ""except Slovenia and Ecuador,"" which implies a filter to exclude these countries. However, the context does not provide any information about countries or filters related to them. Therefore, we cannot include this filter in the structured output based on the given context.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'product name': [{'ENTITY': 'Product Name'}]}}"

- The date reference in the context is ""Order Date"" with other names including ""date,"" ""when,"" ""yoy,"" ""trend,"" ""mom,"" ""time,"" and ""order date.""

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query specifies ""last 10 months"" as the time frame.
- This can be matched to the date variable ""Order Date"" in the context.
- The ""last 10 months"" can be converted into a time element relative to the current date.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Combine the matched components from the context and the converted date/time component.
- The dimensions are ""Country"" and ""City.""
- The date variable is ""Order Date"" with the converted time element ""last 10 months.""

Rationale:
- The query asks for a list of countries and cities within a specific time frame.
- By identifying the components in the query and matching them to the context, we can create a structured output that accurately represents the information requested.
- Converting the date/time component allows for a more precise representation of the time frame in the structured output.","{'DIMENSION': {'countries': [{'ENTITY': 'Country'}], 'cities': [{'ENTITY': 'City'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'past 10 months': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 months'}]}}"

- The query asks for ""monthly profits,"" which refers to the 'Profit' entity in the context.
- The query specifies ""1st quarter,"" which is a time element related to 'Order Date' in the context.
- The query also mentions ""last year,"" which is another time element related to 'Order Date' in the context.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The 'Profit' entity in the query matches the 'Profit' entity in the context, and its other name 'profits' is used in the structured output.
- The 'Order Date' entity in the query matches the 'Order Date' entity in the context, and its other names are used to identify the time elements in the structured output.

Step 3: Convert the date/time components
- The ""monthly"" component in the query is converted to 'across months' in the structured output, indicating that the profits should be calculated for each month.
- The ""1st quarter"" component in the query is converted to 'quarter 1' in the structured output, specifying that the time frame should be limited to the first quarter of the year.
- The ""last year"" component in the query is converted to 'last year' in the structured output, indicating that the time frame should be limited to the previous year.

Rationale:
The query asks for monthly profits in the 1st quarter of last year. To provide this information, we need to calculate the profits for each month within the specified time frame. The structured output captures this by including the 'across months' time element for 'Order Date'. Additionally, the query specifies that the time frame should be limited to the first quarter of the previous year. The structured output captures this by including the 'quarter 1' and 'last year' time elements for 'Order Date'.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'monthly': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across months'}], 'last year': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last year'}]}}"

- In the query ""When was share of sale of ship mode lowest"", we can identify the following components:
  - Share (Derived Measure)
  - Sale (Measure)
  - Ship Mode (Dimension)
  - Lowest (Adjective)
  - When (Date Variable)

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Share: In the context, we find 'ratio' as the entity with other names including 'share'. So, we can map 'share' to the entity 'ratio'.
- Sale: In the context, we find 'Sales' as the entity with other names including 'sale'. So, we can map 'sale' to the entity 'Sales'.
- Ship Mode: In the context, we find 'Ship Mode' as the entity with other names including 'ship mode'. So, we can map 'ship mode' to the entity 'Ship Mode'.
- When: In the context, we find 'Order Date' as the entity with other names including 'when'. So, we can map 'when' to the entity 'Order Date'.

Step 3: Create the structured output
- For the derived measure 'share', we need to specify the applied measure, which is 'sale' mapped to the entity 'Sales'. We also need to include the adjective 'lowest' and the tone 'negative' to indicate that we are looking for the lowest share.
- For the dimension 'ship mode', we map it to the entity 'Ship Mode'.
- For the date variable 'when', we map it to the entity 'Order Date'.

Step 4: Incorporate the date reference

- The query asks for ""discount"" and ""quantities"", which are measures.
- It also mentions ""cities"" and ""region"", which are dimensions.
- The query specifies a time frame of ""across 2 months"".

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""Discount"" can be matched to the entity ""Discount"" in the context.
- ""Quantities"" can be matched to the entity ""Quantity"" in the context.
- ""Cities"" can be matched to the entity ""City"" in the context.
- ""Region"" can be matched to the entity ""Region"" in the context.
- The date reference in the context is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query asks for data ""across 2 months"". Since no specific months are mentioned, we can assume it refers to the last 2 months from the end date in the context ('31/12/2021').
- Therefore, the converted time element is ""last 2 months"".

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Based on the identified components and their matches in the context, the structured output is created with the following elements:
  - MEASURE: {'discount': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount'}], 'quantities': [{'ENTITY': 'Quantity'}]}

  - ""sale"" as a measure

Step 2: Match components to the context
- Match ""ship mode"" to the dimension ""Ship Mode"" in the context
- Match ""sale"" to the measure ""Sales"" in the context
- Match ""share"" to the derived measure ""ratio"" in the context
- Match ""monthly trend"" to the date variable ""Order Date"" in the context

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- The date variable ""monthly trend"" needs to be converted to a time element that represents the trend across months. In the context, ""Order Date"" is the relevant date variable, so we convert ""monthly trend"" to ""across months"" for ""Order Date"".

Rationale:
- The query asks for the monthly trend, which means we need to analyze the data across months. By converting ""monthly trend"" to ""across months"" for ""Order Date"", we ensure that the structured output will provide the desired time-based analysis.

Step 4: Create structured output
- Based on the matched components and the converted date/time component, we can now create the structured output with the following elements:

- In the query ""List of customer id"", the main component is ""customer id"".

Step 2: Match the component to the context
- In the context, we can find a matching entity for ""customer id"" under the 'DIMENSION' section, which is {'ENTITY': 'Customer ID', 'other names': ['customer id']}.

Step 3: Create the structured output for the identified component
- Since ""customer id"" is a dimension, we create a structured output with the 'DIMENSION' key and map it to the corresponding entity in the context. In this case, it would be {'customer id': [{'ENTITY': 'Customer ID'}]}.

Step 4: Identify date/time component in the query
- There is no explicit date/time component mentioned in the query.

Step 5: Match the date/time component to the context
- Since there is no date/time component in the query, we don't need to match it to the context.

Step 6: Create the structured output for the date/time component
- As there is no date/time component in the query, we don't need to create a structured output for it.

Rationale:
- The query is asking for a list of customer ids, which is a dimension in the context. We identified the component in the query and matched it to the corresponding entity in the context. Since there is no date/time component in the query, we didn't need to create a structured output for it.

- The query mentions ""discount percentage of guinea"" which can be matched to the context's ""Discount percentage"" entity.
- The query mentions ""> 50k"" which is a comparison value and operator.
- The query asks ""When was the first time"" which is a date/time component related to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""discount percentage of guinea"" is matched to the ""Discount percentage"" entity in the context.
- ""> 50k"" is a comparison value and operator that needs to be applied as a constraint on the ""Discount percentage"" entity.
- ""When was the first time"" is matched to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context and indicates that we need to find the first occurrence of the specified condition.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date/time component ""When was the first time"" is converted to the ""first time"" element for the ""Order Date"" entity in the structured output.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The ""Discount percentage"" entity is added to the MEASURE section of the output with the constraint ""> 50k"".
- The ""Order Date"" entity is added to the DATE VARIABLE section of the output with the ""first time"" element.

- In the query ""What is the monthly trend of sale and discounts for Kenya"", we can identify the following components:
  - Measure: sale, discounts
  - Date variable: trend (monthly)
  - No explicit dimension, filter, or derived measure mentioned

Step 2: Match components to the context
- Match the identified components to the context provided:
  - Measure: 'sale' matches with 'Sales' entity in the context, and 'discounts' matches with 'Discount' entity in the context
  - Date variable: 'trend' matches with 'Order Date' entity in the context

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- The query asks for the ""monthly trend"", which means we need to convert the 'Order Date' entity to a monthly time element. In the structured output, we add 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across months' to the 'Order Date' entity.

Rationale:
- The query asks for the trend of sales and discounts, which are both measures in the context. We include these measures in the structured output.
- The query specifies a monthly trend, so we need to convert the 'Order Date' entity to a monthly time element. This is done by adding 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across months' to the 'Order Date' entity in the structured output.
- There are no explicit dimensions, filters, or derived measures mentioned in the query, so we don't include them in the structured output.","{'MEASURE': {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}], 'discount patterns': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'monthly trends': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across months'}]}}"

- Overall discount percentage: 'Discount percentage' in MEASURE
- Countries: 'Country' in DIMENSION
- Last 10 months: 'Order Date' in DATE VARIABLE

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query mentions ""last 10 months"" as the timeframe. This needs to be converted into a structured format using the 'Order Date' entity from the DATE VARIABLE in the context. The 'last 10 months' is converted to {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 10 months'}.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- DIMENSION: Map 'countries' to the 'Country' entity from the context.
- DERIVED MEASURE: Map 'growth contribution' to the 'contribution_to_growth' entity from the context and apply the 'Discount percentage' measure to it.
- DATE VARIABLE: Use the converted date/time component from Step 3.

Rationale:
The query asks for the trend of growth contribution to overall discount percentage for countries in the last 10 months. To answer this, we need to identify the relevant entities from the context and map them to the components in the query. The growth contribution is mapped to 'contribution_to_growth', the overall discount percentage is mapped to 'Discount percentage', and countries are mapped to the 'Country' entity. The date/time component is converted using the 'Order Date' entity from the context.

- The query asks for a ""list of ship mode.""
- It mentions ""contributing to sale,"" which implies a ratio or measure related to sales.
- There is no specific filter mentioned in the query.
- The date range is given as 03/01/2018 to 31/12/2021.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""Ship mode"" can be matched to the ""Ship Mode"" entity in the context's DIMENSION.
- ""Sale"" can be matched to the ""Sales"" entity in the context's MEASURE.
- ""Contributing"" can be matched to the ""ratio"" entity in the context's DERIVED MEASURE.
- The date range can be matched to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context's DATE VARIABLE.

Step 3: Convert the query components into structured output
- DIMENSION: Since the query asks for a list of ship modes, we include the ""Ship Mode"" entity in the structured output's DIMENSION.
- DERIVED MEASURE: The query mentions ""contributing to sale,"" which implies a ratio related to sales. We include the ""ratio"" entity in the structured output's DERIVED MEASURE, and specify that it is applied to the ""Sales"" measure. There is no comparison value or operator mentioned in the query, so we leave those fields empty in the DERIVED MEASURE CONSTRAINT.
- FILTER: There is no specific filter mentioned in the query, so we leave the FILTER field empty.
- DATE VARIABLE: The date range is given as 03/01/2018 to 31/12/2021, which can be matched to the ""Order Date"" entity. However, since the structured output does not require the date range to be explicitly mentioned, we do not include it in the output.

Rationale: The structured output is created by identifying the relevant components in the query, matching them to the context, and organizing them into the appropriate fields (DIMENSION, DERIVED MEASURE, FILTER, and DATE VARIABLE). This allows for a clear and concise representation of the query, which can be used for further analysis or processing.","{'MEASURE': {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'ship mode': [{'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'contributing': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'sale': 'Sales'}]}]}}"

- The query mentions ""across 2 months"" which is a date/time component.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The measure ""discount"" can be matched to the entity ""Discount"" in the context.
- The date/time component ""across 2 months"" needs to be converted to a proper date range based on the date reference provided.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'.
- The query asks for the discount ""across 2 months"", which means we need to consider the last 2 months from the end date of the date reference.
- The end date is '31/12/2021', so the last 2 months would be from '01/11/2021' to '31/12/2021'.

Step 2: Match components to the context
- The derived measure ""ratio"" is found in the context.
- The measure ""profits"" is found in the context as ""Profit"".
- The adjective ""highest"" is not found in the context but can be inferred as a positive tone.
- The date variable ""when"" is found in the context as ""Order Date"".

Step 3: Convert the query into a structured output
- For the derived measure ""ratio"", we need to apply the measure ""profits"" to it. We also need to include the adjective ""highest"" and the inferred positive tone.
- For the date variable ""when"", we need to convert it to the context's ""Order Date"".

Rationale:
- The query is asking for the highest ratio of profits between El Salvador and South Sudan, so we need to apply the measure ""profits"" to the derived measure ""ratio"".
- The adjective ""highest"" indicates a positive tone, which is important for understanding the context of the query.
- The date variable ""when"" is used to specify the time frame for the query, so we need to convert it to the context's ""Order Date"" to ensure consistency.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit', 'ADJECTIVE': ['highest'], 'TONE': 'positive'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'ratio': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'when': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date'}]}}"

- Region: Matches with 'Region' in the context
- March 2022: Matches with 'Order Date' in the context

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- March 2022: Convert it to the format used in the context, which is 'March 2022'

Step 4: Structure the output
- DIMENSION: Include 'City' and 'Region' as dimensions
- DERIVED MEASURE: Include 'contribution_to_growth' as the derived measure, and apply it to the 'Discount' measure
- DATE VARIABLE: Include 'Order Date' with the converted time element 'March 2022'

Rationale:
The query asks for the trend of growth contribution to overall discount for cities to region in March 2022. We first identify all the components in the query and match them to the context. Then, we convert the date/time component to the format used in the context. Finally, we structure the output by including the dimensions, derived measure, and date variable as per the identified components and their matches in the context.","{'DIMENSION': {'city': [{'ENTITY': 'City'}], 'region': [{'ENTITY': 'Region'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'growth contribution': [{'ENTITY': 'contribution_to_growth', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discounts': 'Discount percentage'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'March '22': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'March 2022'}]}}"

- The query asks for the time when the discount percentage was lowest in the previous quarter.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- 'Discount percentage' can be matched to the 'Discount percentage' entity in the context.
- 'Lowest' can be matched to the 'ratio' entity in the context, which has 'percentage' as its other name and is a derived measure.
- 'Previous quarter' can be matched to the 'Order Date' entity in the context, which has 'when' as its other name and is a date variable.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'.
- The query asks for the previous quarter, which means we need to find the time range for the last quarter within the given date reference.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The 'MEASURE' component is 'discount percentage', which is matched to the 'Discount percentage' entity in the context.
- The 'DERIVED MEASURE' component is 'percentage', which is matched to the 'ratio' entity in the context. It has the 'APPLIED MEASURE' as 'discount percentage', the 'ADJECTIVE' as 'lowest', and the 'TONE' as 'negative'.
- The 'DATE VARIABLE' component is 'when', which is matched to the 'Order Date' entity in the context. The 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' is 'last quarter', which is derived from the date reference and the query's requirement for the previous quarter.

Rationale: The query asks for the time when the discount percentage was lowest in the previous quarter. By identifying the components in the query and matching them to the context, we can create a structured output that captures the required information.

- Discount percentage: Matches with 'Discount percentage' in the context under 'MEASURE'
- Contributing: Matches with 'ratio' in the context under 'DERIVED MEASURE'
- Previous quarter: Matches with 'Order Date' in the context under 'DATE VARIABLE'

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- Previous quarter: The date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'. The query asks for the previous quarter, so we need to convert the 'Order Date' to 'last quarter' in the structured output.

Rationale:
The query asks for a list of sub-categories that contribute to the discount percentage in the previous quarter. We first identify the components in the query and match them to the context. The 'Sub-Category' is a dimension, and the 'Discount percentage' is a measure. The 'contributing' keyword matches with the 'ratio' derived measure in the context. Finally, we need to consider the time component, which is the previous quarter.

- In the query, we have ""ship mode"", ""monthly trends of sale"", and ""15d"" as the main components.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""ship mode"" can be matched to the ""Ship Mode"" entity in the context under DIMENSION.
- ""sale"" can be matched to the ""Sales"" entity in the context under MEASURE.
- ""monthly trends"" and ""15d"" can be matched to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context under DATE VARIABLE.

Step 3: Convert the date/time components
- ""monthly trends"" refers to a time element that needs to be analyzed across months. So, we convert it to ""across months"" for the ""Order Date"" entity.
- ""15d"" refers to a time element that needs to be analyzed for the last 15 days. So, we convert it to ""last 15 days"" for the ""Order Date"" entity.

Rationale:
- The query asks for a list of ship modes based on the monthly trends of sales in the last 15 days. To achieve this, we need to analyze the data across months and focus on the last 15 days.
- We have matched the components in the query to the context provided and converted the date/time components accordingly to create a structured output that can be used for further analysis.","{'MEASURE': {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'ship mode': [{'ENTITY': 'Ship Mode'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'monthly trends': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across months'}], '15-day': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 15 days'}]}}"

- In the query ""When was contribution of sale of Kenya lowest"", we can identify the following components:
  - ""contribution of sale"" refers to a derived measure, specifically the ""ratio"" or ""contribution"" mentioned in the context.
  - ""lowest"" is an adjective that describes the tone of the derived measure.
  - ""Kenya"" is not mentioned in the context, but it could be a filter or dimension related to the location of the sales.
  - ""When"" refers to a date variable, which can be matched to ""Order Date"" in the context.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""contribution of sale"" can be matched to the derived measure ""ratio"" or ""contribution"" in the context.
- ""lowest"" can be associated with the derived measure as an adjective with a negative tone.
- ""When"" can be matched to the date variable ""Order Date"" in the context.

Step 3: Create the structured output

- In the query ""Forecast of yearly profits"", we can identify the following components:
  1. Forecast: Indicates a prediction or estimation.
  2. Yearly: Indicates a time element, specifically across years.
  3. Profits: Refers to the measure we are interested in.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- We can match the components from the query to the context as follows:
  1. Profits: In the context, we have {'ENTITY': 'Profit', 'other names': ['profits']} under 'MEASURE'. So, we can match 'profits' to this entity.
  2. Yearly: In the context, we have {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'other names': ['date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', 'order date']} under 'DATE VARIABLE'. We can match 'yearly' to this entity and convert it to 'across years' as it refers to a time element across years.

Step 3: Create the structured output
- Based on the matched components and their corresponding entities in the context, we can create the structured output as follows:
  1. 'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}: This represents the measure 'profits' matched to the entity 'Profit' in the context.
  2. 'DATE VARIABLE': {'yearly': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across years'}]}: This represents the time element 'yearly' matched to the entity 'Order Date' in the context and converted to 'across years' as it refers to a time element across years.","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'annual': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across years'}]}}"

- In the given query, we can identify the following components: ""share"", ""el salvador"", ""south sudan"", ""profits"", ""across 2 months"".

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""share"" can be matched to the derived measure ""ratio"" in the context.
- ""profits"" can be matched to the measure ""Profit"" in the context.
- ""across 2 months"" can be matched to the date variable ""Order Date"" in the context.

Step 3: Create the structured output
- For the derived measure ""share"", we need to apply the measure ""profits"" to it. So, we add the ""APPLIED MEASURE"" key with the value [{'profits': 'Profit'}] to the derived measure.
- For the date variable ""trend"", we need to convert the time component ""across 2 months"" to a proper format. So, we add the ""CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT"" key with the value 'across 2 months' to the date variable.

Step 4: Provide rationale for the date/time component conversion
- The date/time component ""across 2 months"" is used to specify the time interval for the trend analysis. In the structured output, we have added this component to the ""CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT"" key of the date variable ""trend"" to indicate that the trend analysis should be done across 2-month intervals within the given date reference (start_date: '03/01/2018', end_date: '31/12/2021').","{'MEASURE': {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'share': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'profits': 'Profit'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 2 months'}]}}"

- The query asks for the ""monthly trend of sale."" This indicates that we need to look at the 'Sales' measure and analyze it over time.
- The time component mentioned is ""monthly,"" which means we need to aggregate the data on a monthly basis.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- In the context, 'Sales' is given as an entity with other names like 'sale.' So, we can match 'sale' from the query to the 'Sales' entity in the context.
- The context also provides a date variable called 'Order Date' with other names like 'trend.' Since the query asks for the trend of sales, we can match 'trend' from the query to the 'Order Date' entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query asks for the ""monthly trend,"" which means we need to aggregate the data on a monthly basis. To do this, we need to convert the 'Order Date' entity into a time element that represents months.
- In the structured output, we add the 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT' key to the 'Order Date' entity and set its value to 'across months.' This indicates that we want to analyze the data on a monthly basis.

Rationale:
- The query asks for the trend of sales, which requires analyzing the 'Sales' measure over time. By matching the components from the query to the context, we can identify the relevant entities and their relationships.
- The time component in the query is ""monthly,"" which means we need to aggregate the data on a monthly basis. By converting the 'Order Date' entity into a time element representing months, we can ensure that the analysis is done correctly.","{'MEASURE': {'sale': [{'ENTITY': 'Sales'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'trend': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across months'}]}}"

- Sub-category: Sub-Category
- Except India: Country
- Previous quarter: Order Date

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The query mentions ""previous quarter,"" which can be converted to ""last quarter"" for the Order Date entity.

Rationale:
- The query asks for the growth contribution to the overall discount percentage for sub-categories, excluding India, in the previous quarter.
- The growth contribution is identified as a derived measure, and it is matched to the ""contribution_to_growth"" entity in the context.
- The overall discount percentage is identified as a measure and matched to the ""Discount percentage"" entity in the context.
- The sub-category is identified as a dimension and matched to the ""Sub-Category"" entity in the context.
- The exclusion of India is identified as a filter and matched to the ""Country"" entity in the context.
- The previous quarter is identified as a date variable and matched to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context. It is then converted to ""last quarter"" for the structured output.","{'DIMENSION': {'sub category': [{'ENTITY': 'Sub-Category'}]}, 'DERIVED MEASURE': {'growth share': [{'ENTITY': 'contribution_to_growth', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount %': 'Discount percentage'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'previous Q': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last quarter'}]}}"

- The query mentions ""sale"" which can be matched to the ""Sales"" entity in the context.
- The query mentions ""discounts"" which can be matched to the ""Discount"" entity in the context.
- The query mentions ""last time"" which indicates a date/time component.
- The query has two measure constraints: ""sale > 50k"" and ""discounts < 15k"".

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""sale"" can be matched to the ""Sales"" entity in the context, with other names including ""sale"".
- ""discounts"" can be matched to the ""Discount"" entity in the context, with other names including ""discounts"".

Step 3: Convert the measure constraints
- For the ""Sales"" entity, the measure constraint is ""sale > 50k"". The comparison value is ""50k"" and the comparison operator is "">"".
- For the ""Discount"" entity, the measure constraint is ""discounts < 15k"". The comparison value is ""15k"" and the comparison operator is ""<"".

Step 4: Convert the date/time component
- The query mentions ""last time"", which can be matched to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context, with other names including ""time"" and ""when"".
- The converted time element is ""last time"".

- In the query ""What is the profits and discounts by customer id in the last 10 days"", we can identify the following components:
  - Profits
  - Discounts
  - Customer ID
  - Last 10 days

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- We match the identified components to the context provided:
  - Profits: {'ENTITY': 'Profit', 'other names': ['profits']}
  - Discounts: {'ENTITY': 'Discount', 'other names': ['discounts', 'discount'], 'dataset_id': '6538e14185a957419006d762_2'}

  - Last 10 days: {'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'other names': ['trend', 'yoy', 'mom', 'date', 'order date', 'when', 'time']}

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date/time component in the query is ""last 10 days"". We need to convert this into a structured format using the date reference provided:
  - Start date: 03/01/2018
  - End date: 31/12/2021
- Since the query asks for the last 10 days, we can calculate the date range by subtracting 10 days from the end date (31/12/2021). This gives us a new date range for the ""last 10 days"" component.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- Using the matched components and the converted date/time component, we can now create the structured output:
  - MEASURE: {'profits': [{'ENTITY': 'Profit'}], 'discounts': [{'ENTITY': 'Discount'}]}

- In the query, we have the following components: discount percentage, shipping cost, profits, sub-category, and across 2 months.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- Discount percentage: Found in the context as 'Discount percentage' under MEASURE.
- Shipping cost: Found in the context as 'Shipping Cost' under MEASURE.
- Profits: Found in the context as 'Profit' under MEASURE.
- Sub-category: Found in the context as 'Sub-Category' under DIMENSION.
- Across 2 months: Found in the context as 'Order Date' under DATE VARIABLE.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'.
- The query asks for data ""across 2 months"", which means we need to consider the last 2 months from the end date of the date reference.

Step 2: Match components to the context
- Measure: ""profits"" can be matched to the ""Profit"" entity in the context.
- Filter: ""envelopes"" can be matched to the ""Envelopes"" entity with parent ""Sub-Category"" in the context. ""thailand"" can be matched to the ""Southeast Asia"" entity with parent ""Region"" in the context.
- Date variable: ""last 10 days"" can be matched to the ""Order Date"" entity in the context.

Step 3: Convert date/time component
- The date variable ""last 10 days"" needs to be converted to a specific date range. Since the end date in the date reference is ""31/12/2021"", we can calculate the start date for the last 10 days as ""22/12/2021"".

- In the query ""What is the contribution of haiti for discount percentage"", we can identify the following components:
  - Derived Measure: ""contribution""
  - Entity: ""haiti""
  - Measure: ""discount percentage""

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- From the given context, we can match the following components:
  - Derived Measure: ""contribution"" matches with ""ratio"" in the context.
  - Measure: ""discount percentage"" matches with ""Discount percentage"" in the context.

Step 3: Identify the date/time component
- The date reference is given as {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}.
- In the query, there is no specific date or time component mentioned. Therefore, we can assume that the query is asking for the contribution of Haiti for discount percentage within the given date range.

Step 4: Convert the query into a structured output
- Based on the identified components and their matches in the context, we can create the structured output as follows:
  - For the Derived Measure ""contribution"", we can use the ""contribution_to_growth"" entity from the context.
  - We can apply the measure ""discount percentage"" from the context to the ""contribution_to_growth"" entity.
  - Since there is no specific comparison value or operator mentioned in the query, we can leave the ""DERIVED MEASURE CONSTRAINT"" empty.

Rationale:
- The structured output is created by identifying the components in the query, matching them with the context, and considering the given date range. The output represents the contribution of Haiti for discount percentage within the specified date range, using the derived measure ""contribution_to_growth"" and applying the measure ""discount percentage"" from the context.","{'DERIVED MEASURE': {'contribution': [{'ENTITY': 'ratio', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount percentage': 'Discount percentage'}], 'DERIVED MEASURE CONSTRAINT': [{'COMPARISON VALUE': '', 'COMPARISON OPERATOR': ''}]}]}}"
Can you provide subcategory list and order priority?,List of sub category and order priority,list,"{'MEASURE': [], 'DIMENSION': [{'ENTITY': 'Category', 'other names': ['category', 'categories']}, {'ENTITY': 'Sub-Category', 'other names': ['sub category'], 'dataset_id': '6538e14185a957419006d762'}, {'ENTITY': 'Order Priority', 'other names': ['order priority'], 'dataset_id': '6538e14185a957419006d762'}, {'ENTITY': 'Order ID', 'other names': ['order id'], 'dataset_id': '6538e14185a957419006d762'}], 'FILTER': [], 'DERIVED MEASURE': [], 'DATE VARIABLE': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'other names': ['date', 'when', 'yoy', 'trend', 'mom', 'time', 'order date']}]}","{'DIMENSION': {'sub category': [{'ENTITY': 'Sub-Category'}], 'order priority': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Priority'}]}}","Step 1: Identify the components in the query
The query asks for a ""List of sub category and order priority"". Here, we can identify two components: ""sub category"" and ""order priority"".

Step 2: Match the components to the context
We look at the context and find matches for the identified components. In the context, we find the following matches:
- ""sub category"" matches with the entity ""Sub-Category"" and its other names.
- ""order priority"" matches with the entity ""Order Priority"" and its other names.

Step 3: Identify the date/time component
The date reference is given as {'start_date': '03/01/2018', 'end_date': '31/12/2021'}. This information will be used to filter the data based on the date range.

Step 4: Convert the query into structured output
Based on the identified components and their matches in the context, we create a structured output. In this case, the structured output will have the 'DIMENSION' key with the matched entities from the context:
- 'sub category' is matched with the entity 'Sub-Category'
- 'order priority' is matched with the entity 'Order Priority'

The final structured output will look like this:
{'DIMENSION': {'sub category': [{'ENTITY': 'Sub-Category'}], 'order priority': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Priority'}]}}","{'DIMENSION': {'sub category': [{'ENTITY': 'Sub-Category'}], 'order priority': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Priority'}]}}"

- The query asks for the ""yearly growth rate"" which is a derived measure.
- The measure to be applied is ""discount percentage"".
- The date variable is ""previous quarter"".

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- The derived measure ""yearly growth rate"" can be matched to the entity ""Growth Rate"" in the context.
- The measure ""discount percentage"" can be matched to the entity ""Discount percentage"" in the context.
- The date variable ""previous quarter"" can be matched to the entity ""Order Date"" in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'.
- The query asks for the ""previous quarter"", which means we need to find the growth rate for the last quarter within the given date range.
- The query also asks for the ""yearly"" growth rate, which means we need to calculate the growth rate across years within the given date range.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The derived measure ""yearly growth rate"" is applied to the measure ""discount percentage"".
- The date variable ""previous quarter"" is converted to ""last quarter"" for the entity ""Order Date"".
- The date variable ""yearly"" is converted to ""across years"" for the entity ""Order Date"".

Rationale: The structured output is created by identifying the components in the query, matching them to the context, converting the date/time component, and applying the derived measure to the measure. This allows for a clear and structured representation of the query, making it easier to process and analyze.","{'DERIVED MEASURE': {'annual growth rate': [{'ENTITY': 'Growth Rate', 'APPLIED MEASURE': [{'discount %': 'Discount percentage'}]}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'past quarter': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last quarter'}], 'annual': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'across years'}]}}"

- The query mentions ""List of customer id"", which corresponds to the ""Customer ID"" dimension in the context.
- The query mentions ""except Ireland"", which is a filter condition for the ""Country"" dimension in the context.
- The query mentions ""across 3 years"", which is a date/time component related to the ""Order Date"" date variable in the context.

Step 2: Match the components to the context
- ""Customer ID"" in the query matches the ""Customer ID"" dimension in the context.
- ""Ireland"" in the query is a filter condition for the ""Country"" dimension in the context.
- ""3 years"" in the query corresponds to the ""Order Date"" date variable in the context.

Step 3: Convert the date/time component
- The date reference provided is from '03/01/2018' to '31/12/2021'.
- The query mentions ""across 3 years"", which means we need to consider the last 3 years from the end date of the date reference.
- Subtracting 3 years from the end date '31/12/2021' gives us a new start date of '01/01/2019'.
- The converted time element for the ""Order Date"" date variable is 'last 3 years'.

Step 4: Create the structured output
- The structured output should include the ""Customer ID"" dimension, the ""Country"" filter condition (excluding Ireland), and the ""Order Date"" date variable with the converted time element ('last 3 years').
- The final structured output is created by combining these components, as shown in the provided output.","{'MEASURE': {'customer id': [{'ENTITY': 'Long'}]}, 'DIMENSION': {'customer id': [{'ENTITY': 'Customer ID'}]}, 'DATE VARIABLE': {'past 3 years': [{'ENTITY': 'Order Date', 'CONVERTED TIME ELEMENT': 'last 3 years'}]}}"
